However, O

To O

For O

COX-2 B-GENE-Y

Consequently, O

For O

OBJECTIVES: O
The O
hypothesis O
of O
the O
present O
study O
was O
that O
differences O
among O
dopamine B-GENE-N
transporter I-GENE-N
(DAT) B-GENE-N
ligands O
in O
potency O
and O
effectiveness O
as O
a O
positive O
reinforcers O
were O
related O
to O
potency O
and O
effectiveness O
as O
DA B-CHEMICAL
uptake O
inhibitors. O
Accordingly, O
self-administration O
of O
a O
group O
of O
local O
anesthetics O
that O
are O
DAT B-GENE-N
ligands O
was O
compared O
to O
their O
effects O
as O
DA B-CHEMICAL
uptake O
blockers O
in O

in O
brain O
tissue. O
METHODS: O
Rhesus O
monkeys O
were O
allowed O
to O
self-administer O
cocaine B-CHEMICAL
and O
other O
local O
anesthetics O
i.v. O
under O
a O
progressive-ratio O
schedule. O
The O
same O
compounds O
were O
compared O
in O
standard O
in O

DA B-CHEMICAL

assays O
using O
monkey O
caudate O

RESULTS: O
The O
rank O
order O
of O
both O
potency O
and O
effectiveness O
as O
reinforcers O
was O
cocaine B-CHEMICAL
> O
dimethocaine B-CHEMICAL
> O
procaine B-CHEMICAL
> O
chloroprocaine. B-CHEMICAL
Tetracaine B-CHEMICAL
did O
not O
maintain O
self-administration. O
For O
inhibiting O

uptake, O
the O
potency O
order O

was O
cocaine B-CHEMICAL
> O
dimethocaine B-CHEMICAL
> O
tetracaine B-CHEMICAL
> O
procaine B-CHEMICAL

chloro-procaine. B-CHEMICAL
At O
maximum, O
these O
compounds O
were O
equally O
effective O
in O
blocking O
DA B-CHEMICAL
uptake. O
Lidocaine B-CHEMICAL
did O
not O
inhibit O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
potency O
of O
local O
anesthetics O
as O
positive O
reinforcers O
is O
likely O
related O
to O
their O
potency O
as O
DA B-CHEMICAL
uptake O
inhibitors. O
Variation O
in O
their O
effectiveness O
as O
positive O
reinforcers O
was O
not O
a O
function O
of O
differences O
in O
effectiveness O
as O
DA B-CHEMICAL
uptake O
blockers, O
but O
may O
be O
related O
to O
relative O
potency O
over O
the O
concentrations O
that O

are O
achieved O
in O

In O
conclusion, O

The O

The O

Considerable O

that O
serotonergic O

the O

We O

Two O

The O

The O
molecular O
mechanism O
for O
the O
anti-inflammatory O

of O
theophylline B-CHEMICAL
is O
currently O
unknown, O
but O
low-dose O
theophylline B-CHEMICAL
is O
an O
effective O
add-on O
therapy O
to O

in O

Corticosteroids B-CHEMICAL
act, O
at O

by O
recruitment O

histone B-GENE-N
deacetylases I-GENE-N
(HDACs) B-GENE-N
to O
the O
site O
of O
active O

They O
thereby O
inhibit O
the O
acetylation O
of O
core O
histones O
that O
is O
necessary O
for O
inflammatory O
gene O
transcription. O
We O
show O
both O
in O

in O

that O
low-dose O
theophylline B-CHEMICAL
enhances O
HDAC B-GENE-N

activity O
in O
epithelial O

macrophages. O
This O
increased O
HDAC B-GENE-N
activity O
is O
then O
available O
for O
corticosteroid B-CHEMICAL
recruitment O
and O
predicts O
a O
cooperative O
interaction O
between O

theophylline. B-CHEMICAL
This O

occurs O
at O

The O

are O
critical O
for O

injury. O
Thalidomide B-CHEMICAL
has O
been O
shown O
to O
suppress O
TNF-alpha B-GENE-Y
production O
from O
macrophages. O
Accordingly, O
the O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
determine O
whether O
thalidomide B-CHEMICAL
could O
prevent O
alcohol-induced B-CHEMICAL
liver O
injury. O
METHODS: O
Rats O
were O
given O
ethanol B-CHEMICAL
(5 O
g/kg O
body O

and O
thalidomide B-CHEMICAL
(5 O
mg/kg) O
once O
every O
24 O
hours O
intragastrically. O
To O
assess O
the O
sensitization O
of O
Kupffer O
cells, O
LPS O
(5 O

mg/kg O
intravenously) O
was O
administered O
and O
liver O
histology O
was O
evaluated O
24 O
hours O
later. O
KCs O
were O
isolated O
after O
4 O
weeks O
of O
ethanol B-CHEMICAL
treatment O
and O
intracellular O
Ca2+ B-CHEMICAL
([Ca2+]i) B-CHEMICAL
was O
measured O
using O
fura-2, O
whereas O
TNF-alpha B-GENE-Y
was O
evaluated O
by O
reverse-transcription O
polymerase O
chain O
reaction O
and O
enzyme-linked O
immunosorbent O
assay. O
CD14 B-GENE-Y
was O
determined O
by O
Western O
and O
fluorescence O
staining. O
RESULTS: O
Treatment O
with O
ethanol B-CHEMICAL
for O
8 O
weeks O
caused O
marked O
steatosis, O
necrosis, O
and O
inflammation O
in O
the O
liver. O
These O

pathologic O
parameters O
were O
diminished O
markedly O
by O
treatment O
with O
thalidomide. B-CHEMICAL
In O
the O
4-week O
ethanol B-CHEMICAL
group, O
the O
LPS-induced O
liver O
damage O
was O
aggravated O
and O
KCs O
were O
sensitized O
to O
LPS. O
Coadministration O
of O
thalidomide B-CHEMICAL
with O
ethanol B-CHEMICAL
prevented O
the O
KC O
sensitization O
completely. O
Furthermore, O
thalidomide B-CHEMICAL
abolished O
the O
LPS-induced O
increase O
in O
CD14 B-GENE-Y
expression O
and O
[Ca2+]i B-CHEMICAL
elevation O
in O
KCs. O
Gut O
permeability O
was O
increased O
about O
10-fold O
after O
4 O
weeks O
of O
ethanol B-CHEMICAL
exposure, O
which O
was O
not O
affected O
by O

thalidomide. B-CHEMICAL
Moreover, O
thalidomide B-CHEMICAL
reduced O
the O
LPS-induced O
TNF-alpha B-GENE-Y
production O
by O
KCs O
by O
decreasing O
TNF-alpha B-GENE-Y
messenger O

CONCLUSIONS: O
These O
results O
collectively O
indicate O
that O
thalidomide B-CHEMICAL
prevents O
alcoholic O
liver O
injury O
through O
suppression O
of O
TNF-alpha B-GENE-Y

During O

spermine B-CHEMICAL

respectively. O
In O
attempting O

clone O
the O
PAO B-GENE-Y
involved O
in O
this O

we O
encountered O
an O

When O

75% O
while O

suggesting O
that O

The O

Overall, O
the O
data O
indicate O
that O
the O
enzyme O
represents O
a O
novel O
mammalian B-GENE-N

oxidase I-GENE-N
which, O
on O
the O
basis O

we O
have O
designated O

The O

The O

these O

further O
support O
a O

Because O

known O

a O
major O
activator O

TGF-beta1 B-GENE-Y
in O

we O
hypothesized O
that O

responsible O
for O
the O

Overall, O

PURPOSE: O
The O

to O
determine O
whether O

and O
whether O
the O
promising O
antitumor O

We O

METHODS: O
Seven O
human O
cell O

established O
from O
breast, O
prostate, O
epidermoid, O

lung O
carcinomas O

We O

RESULTS: O
The O
tumor O

released O
growth O

into O
their O

that O
stimulated O
growth O
of O
endothelial O

Heparin-affinity O

showed O
that O

contributed O
substantially O
to O
this O
paracrine O

and O
that O

Six O
of O
the O
seven O
tumor O

were O
resistant O
to O
PPS O
in O

hence O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
depend O
on O

In O

resistance, O
subcutaneous O

CONCLUSIONS: O
We O
conclude O
that O
heparin-binding B-GENE-N
growth I-GENE-N
factors I-GENE-N
contribute O
substantially O
to O
tumor O
growth O
in O

that O

Utilizing O

via O
a O
G(i/o)-coupled B-GENE-N

(i.e. O

Unlike O
OFQ B-GENE-Y
II(1-17), I-GENE-Y
high O

and O
the O

blocked O
by O
naloxone. B-CHEMICAL
To O
explore O
these O
observations, O
we O
evaluated O
the O
receptor O

profile O
of O
OFQ B-GENE-Y
II(1-28) I-GENE-Y
at O
the O
cloned O

OFQ B-GENE-Y

had O

no O

or O
mu B-GENE-Y
opioid I-GENE-Y

at O
concentrations O
up O

50 O
microM. O
This O
lack O
of O

was O
not O
consistent O
with O
a O
mu-mediated O
effect, O
as O
suggested O
by O
preliminary O
observation O
using O
functional O
autoradiography O
in O
rat O
brain O
sections. O
Although O
behavioral O
studies O
suggest O
that O
OFQ B-GENE-Y
II(1-28) I-GENE-Y
possesses O
analgesic O
activity, O
this O
effect O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
mediated O
via O
direct O
binding O
at O
the O
mu B-GENE-Y
opioid I-GENE-Y
receptor. I-GENE-Y
Taken O
together, O
these O
findings O
support O
the O
view O
that O
(1) O
OFQ B-GENE-Y
is O
the O
only O
ppOFQ B-GENE-N
peptide O
that O
binds O
to O
and O
activates O
the O

ORL1 B-GENE-N

and O
(2) O
OFQ B-GENE-Y

The O

was O
employed O
to O
identify O

inhibitors O
of O
bacterial B-GENE-N

Active O

joined O
by O
a O
polymethylene O

with O
one O

group O
containing O
a O

Effective O

of O
NAD B-GENE-N

also O
inhibited O
the O
growth O
of O
Gram-positive O
(but O
not O
Gram-negative) O
bacteria, O
including O
antibiotic-resistant O
strains. O
The O
desmethyl O
precursors O
of O
active O
inhibitors O
lacked O
a O
permanent O
positive O
charge O
and O
were O
inactive O
as O
either O
enzyme O

antibacterial O
agents. O
Similarly, O
a O
close O
structural O
analogue O
of O
the O
most O
active O

contained O
two O
additional O
ether O
oxygens B-CHEMICAL
in O

These O
results O
are O

with O
the O
premise O
that O
NAD B-GENE-N

BACKGROUND: O

ineffective O
in O

However, O

We O
postulated O
that O

The O

tazarotene B-CHEMICAL
were O
determined O
over O
12 O

in O

Commonly O

Dose-limiting O

The O
maximum O

of O
tazarotene B-CHEMICAL
in O
this O

25.2 O

The O

The O

We O

that O

In O

Resistance O

rather O

The O

There O

whereas O
the O

Gallium B-CHEMICAL

in O
humans O
soon O
after O
the O

It O
has O
the O
unique O
property O
of O
inhibiting O
tumor O

as O
a O
simple O
cation, O
mainly O
because O
of O
its O
close O

Even O
though O
its O
inability O
to O
shift O
between O
the O

precludes O
that O
gallium B-CHEMICAL
behaves O
as O
an O
iron B-CHEMICAL

every O

it O
strongly O

Furthermore, O
gallium B-CHEMICAL
also O
seems O
to O
affect O
intracellular O
availability O
of O
iron B-CHEMICAL
already O
taken O
up O
via O
this O

probably O
due O
to O
its O
inhibitory O

Apart O
from O
the O

gallium B-CHEMICAL
exerts O
cytotoxic O

by O

interaction O
with O

Both O
the O

However, O
some O

raise O
the O
question O
whether O
these O

from O
the O
iron-mimicking B-CHEMICAL
properties O

gallium B-CHEMICAL
are O
solely O
responsible O
for O
its O
antineoplastic O

whether O
additional O

such O

These O

have O
both O

with O
the O

gallium B-CHEMICAL

Gallium B-CHEMICAL

Although O

Here, O
we O
show O
that O
the O

SV2A I-GENE-Y
is O
the O

is O
enriched O
in O

confirms O
that O
it O

Brain O

from O

lacking O

SV2A B-GENE-Y
do O
not O
bind O
a O
tritiated O
LEV B-CHEMICAL

indicating O
that O
SV2A B-GENE-Y
is O
necessary O
for O
LEV B-CHEMICAL
binding. O
LEV B-CHEMICAL
and O
related O
compounds O
bind O
to O
SV2A B-GENE-Y

indicating O
that O

No O

Furthermore, O
there O

Finally, O
there O

a O
strong O

correlation O

the O

its O

in O
an O

These O
experimental O
results O
suggest O
that O
SV2A B-GENE-Y
is O
the O

of O
LEV B-CHEMICAL
in O
the O
brain O
and O
that O
LEV B-CHEMICAL
acts O
by O

the O

that O
LEV B-CHEMICAL

a O

Further, O
these O
results O
indicate O
that O
proteins O

We O

strongly O
inhibits O
lipopolysaccharide O
(LPS)-induced O
TNF B-GENE-Y

These O

of O
the O
Th1 O
cytokine B-GENE-N
interferon-gamma, B-GENE-Y
independent O

monoamine B-GENE-N
transporter I-GENE-N
blockade. O
In O
this O
study, O
antidepressants O
with O
selectivity O
for O
the O
noradrenaline B-GENE-Y
transporter I-GENE-Y
(reboxetine B-CHEMICAL
and O

desipramine), B-CHEMICAL
or O
the O
serotonin B-CHEMICAL
transporter I-GENE-Y
(fluoxetine B-CHEMICAL
and O
clomipramine) B-CHEMICAL
were O
examined O
in O
terms O
of O
their O
ability O
to O
promote O
an O
anti-inflammatory O
cytokine B-GENE-N
phenotype O
in O
human O
blood. O
In O
addition, O
we O
examined O
the O
ability O
of O
trimipramine; B-CHEMICAL
a O
tricyclic B-CHEMICAL
antidepressant O
that O
is O
devoid O
of O
monoamine B-CHEMICAL
reuptake O
inhibitory O
properties O
on O
cytokine B-GENE-N
production. O
Lipopolysaccharide O
(LPS) O
was O
used O
to O
stimulate O
monocyte-derived O
pro-inflammatory O
(IL-1beta, B-GENE-Y
TNF-alpha, B-GENE-Y

IL-12) B-GENE-N
and O
anti-inflammatory O
(IL-10) B-GENE-Y
cytokines, B-GENE-N
whilst O
concanavalin O
A O
(Con O

was O
used O
to O
stimulate O
T-cell O
(Th(1): O
IFN-gamma B-GENE-Y
and O
Th(2/3): O
IL-10) B-GENE-Y
cytokines. B-GENE-N
All O
of O
the O
antidepressants O
suppressed O
IFN-gamma B-GENE-Y
production O
in O
the O
10-50 O
microM O
concentration O
range, O
irrespective O
of O
their O
preference O
for O
serotonin B-GENE-N
or I-GENE-N
noradrenaline I-GENE-N
transporters. I-GENE-N
This O
suppression O
of O
IFN-gamma B-GENE-Y
production O
was O
paralleled O
by O
reduced O
T-cell O
proliferation, O
therefore O
we O

suggest O
that O
the O
ability O
of O
antidepressants O
to O
suppress O
IFN-gamma B-GENE-Y
production O
may O
be O
related O
to O
their O
anti-proliferative O
properties. O
The O
fact O
that O
trimipramine B-CHEMICAL
also O
suppressed O
IFN-gamma B-GENE-Y
production O
and O
T-cell O
proliferation O
indicates O
that O
these O
immunomodulatory O
actions O
of O
antidepressants O
are O
most O
likely O
unrelated O
to O
inhibition O
of O
monoamine B-CHEMICAL
reuptake. O
Interestingly, O
exposure O
to O
a O
lower O
concentration O
(1 O
microM) O
of O
the O
antidepressants O
tended O
to O
increase O
T-cell-derived O
IL-10 B-GENE-Y
production, O
with O
significant O
effects O
elicited O
by O
the O
noradrenaline B-CHEMICAL
reuptake O

inhibitors O
reboxetine B-CHEMICAL
and O
desipramine. B-CHEMICAL
In O
contrast O
to O
the O
robust O
actions O
of O
antidepressants O
on O
T-cell O
derived O
cytokine B-GENE-N
production, O
they O
failed O
to O
induce O
any O
consistent O
change O
in O
LPS-induced O
monocyte O
cytokine B-GENE-N
production. O
Overall, O
our O
results O
indicate O
that O
IFN-gamma B-GENE-Y
producing O
T-cells O
(Th(1) O
cells) O
are O
the O
major O
target O
for O
the O
immunomodulatory O
actions O
of O
antidepressants, O
and O
provide O
evidence O
questioning O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
monoaminergic O
reuptake O
properties O
of O
antidepressants O
and O
their O

immunomodulatory O
effects. O
The O
potential O

is O
discussed. O
Effect O
of O
cyproheptadine B-CHEMICAL
on O
serum O
leptin B-GENE-Y
levels. O
Leptin B-GENE-Y
is O
a O
167 O
amino B-CHEMICAL
acid I-CHEMICAL
protein O
encoded O
by O
the O
obesity O
gene O
that O
is O
synthesized O
in O
adipose O
tissue O
and O
interacts O
with O
receptors O
in O
the O
hypothalamus O
linked O
to O
the O
regulation O
of O
appetite O
and O
metabolism. O
It O
is O
known O
to O
suppress O
appetite O
and O
increase O
energy O
expenditure. O
Cyproheptadine B-CHEMICAL
is O
a O
piperidine B-CHEMICAL
antihistamine B-CHEMICAL
that O
increases O
appetite O
through O
its O
antiserotonergic O
effect O
on O

5-HT2 B-GENE-Y
receptors O
in O
the O
brain. O
Although O
both O
leptin B-GENE-Y
and O
cyproheptadine B-CHEMICAL
are O
effective O
in O
controlling O
appetite, O
their O
interaction O
has O
not O
been O
addressed O
in O
clinical O
studies. O
This O
study O
evaluated O
serum O
leptin O
concentrations O
in O
patients O
who O
received O
cyproheptadine B-CHEMICAL
to O
treat O
a O
variety O
of O
disorders. O
Sixteen O
patients O
aged O
7 O
to O
71 O
years O
(mean, O
26.25 O
years) O
were O
given O
cyproheptadine B-CHEMICAL
2 O
to O
6 O
mg/day O
for O
a O
minimum O
of O
7 O
days. O
Body O
weight O
was O
measured O
and O
blood O
samples O
were O
obtained O
at O
baseline O
and O
after O
1 O
week O
of O
treatment. O
Serum O
leptin B-GENE-Y

levels O
were O
determined O
by O
leptin B-GENE-Y
radioimmunoassay. O
The O
mean O
body O
weight O
at O
baseline O
(52.59 O
kg) O
did O
not O
differ O
significantly O
from O
that O
at O
1 O
week O
after O
treatment O
(52.84 O
kg; O
P O
> O
.05), O
but O
the O
mean O
leptin B-GENE-Y
level O
after O
1 O
week O
of O
treatment O
with O
cyproheptadine B-CHEMICAL
(3.14 O
ng/mL) O
was O
14.2% O
higher O
than O
that O
at O
baseline O
(2.75 O
ng/mL; O
P O
< O
.05). O
This O
increase O
may O
suggest O
that O
both O
leptin B-GENE-Y
and O
cyproheptadine B-CHEMICAL
may O
affect O
appetite O
via O

similar O
receptors O
and O
that O
cyproheptadine B-CHEMICAL
does O
not O
impair O
leptin O
activity O
through O
these O
receptors. O
Further O

At O
each O

The O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Atosiban B-CHEMICAL

(TS) B-GENE-Y
is O
an O
important O
enzyme O
for O
DNA O
synthesis O
and O
the O
target O
for O
5-fluorouracil B-CHEMICAL

Its O

determine O
the O

We O
examined O

CONCLUSION: O
Especially O
patients O

with O
low-TS B-GENE-Y
values O
seemed O
to O
have O
taken O
advantage O
from O
an O

protocol. O
However O
due O
to O
the O
heterogeneous O
group O
of O
patients O
in O
the O
present O
report, O
larger O
trials O
of O
more O

A O

human B-GENE-Y
serine B-CHEMICAL
dehydratase I-GENE-Y
(SDH) B-GENE-Y
is O
deposited O
in O
the O
GenBank/EMBL O
databases, O
but O
its O
structural O
and O
functional O
bases O
remain O
unknown. O
Despite O
the O
occurrence O
of O
mRNA, O
the O
expected O
protein O
level O
was O
found O
to O
be O
low O
in O
cultured O

To O
learn O
about O
physicochemical O
properties O
of O
the O
protein, O
we O
expressed O
the O
cDNA O
in O
Escherichia O

and O
compared O
the O

protein O
with O
that O
of O
a O
hepatic O

The O
purified O
protein O
showed O
l-serine B-CHEMICAL

l-threonine B-CHEMICAL
dehydratase I-GENE-Y
activity, O
demonstrating O
to O
be O
an O
isoform O
of O
SDH. B-GENE-Y
However, O
their O
Km O
and O
Vmax O
constants O
were O
different O
in O
a O
range O
of O
two-order. O
Removal O
of O

from O
the O

which O
is O
missing O
in O
the O
corresponding O
position O
of O
the O
isoform O
consisting O
of O
329 O
residues, O
significantly O
changed O
the O
Michaelis O

and O
Kd O
value O
for O
pyridoxal B-CHEMICAL
5'-phosphate, I-CHEMICAL
whereas O
addition O
of O
a O
proline B-CHEMICAL
residue O
to O
the O

isoform O
was O
without O

These O
findings O
suggest O
the O
difference O
in O
the O
structures O
of O
the O
active O

of O
the O
two O
enzymes. O
Another O
striking O
feature O
was O
that O
the O
expressed O
level O
of O
the O
isoform O
in O
E. O

was O
7-fold O
lower O
than O
that O
of O
the O
hepatic O
SDH. B-GENE-Y
Substitution O
of O
Val B-GENE-N
for I-GENE-N
Leu287 I-GENE-N
in O
the O
isoform O
dramatically O
increased O
the O

level. O
The O
high O
yield O
of O
the O
mutated O
isoform O
was O
also O
confirmed O
by O
the O

The O
poor O

that O

of O

The O

BACKGROUND: O
L-arginine B-CHEMICAL
(L-arg) B-CHEMICAL
participates O
in O
numerous O
biological O
functions O
including O
urea B-CHEMICAL
and O
nitric B-CHEMICAL
oxide I-CHEMICAL
synthesis. O
Sources O
of O
L-arg B-CHEMICAL
include O
dietary O
proteins O
and O

endogenous O
synthesis O
by O
argininosuccinate B-CHEMICAL
synthetase I-GENE-Y
and O
argininosuccinate B-GENE-Y
lyase. I-GENE-Y
L-arg B-CHEMICAL
is O
converted O
to O
urea B-CHEMICAL
by O
arginase B-GENE-Y
I I-GENE-Y
in O
the O
liver O
and O
arginase B-GENE-Y
II I-GENE-Y
in O
the O
kidney. O
Normally, O
the O
liver O
fully O
consumes O
L-arg B-CHEMICAL
for O
urea B-CHEMICAL
generation O
and O
does O
not O
contribute O
to O
its O
circulating O
pool. O
Instead, O
much O
of O
the O
circulating O
L-arg B-CHEMICAL
is O
produced O
by O
the O
kidney. O
If O
true, O
plasma O
L-arg B-CHEMICAL
should O
be O
severely O
reduced O
in O
chronic O
renal O
failure O
(CRF); O
however, O
plasma O
L-arg B-CHEMICAL
is O
frequently O
unchanged O

in O
CRF. O
We O
hypothesized O
that O
preservation O
of O
plasma O
L-arg B-CHEMICAL
in O
CRF O
may O
be, O
partly, O
due O
to O
downregulation/inhibition O
of O
arginase. B-GENE-N

6 O

In O
addition, O
arginase B-GENE-N

was O
measured O
in O
the O

of O
different O

similar O
among O
the O
CRF O
and O
control O
groups. O
However, O
in O

experiments O
simulating O
a O
uremic O
milieu O
revealed O
a O
marked O
concentration-dependent O
inhibition O
of O
arginase B-GENE-N

by O
urea B-CHEMICAL
in O
the O
tissue O
lysates. O

effect O
on O
argininosuccinate B-CHEMICAL
synthetase I-GENE-Y

the O

or O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Although O
CRF O
does O

not O
change O
the O
abundance O
or O
intrinsic O
properties O
of O
arginase, B-GENE-N
the O
inherent O
rise O
in O
urea B-CHEMICAL
concentration O
inhibits O
its O
enzymatic O
activity. O
The O
latter, O
in O
turn, O
attenuates O
L-arg B-CHEMICAL

and O
urea O
production O
and, O
thereby, O
mitigates O
the O

currently O

the O
results O

epratuzumab O
in O
the O
regulation O

B-cell B-GENE-N
antigen I-GENE-N
receptor I-GENE-N
(BCR) B-GENE-N
activation. O
Epratuzumab O
and O
rituximab O
displayed O
very O
distinct O
modes O
of O
action; O
epratuzumab O
acts O
as O
an O
immunomodulatory O
agent, O
while O
rituximab O
is O
an O
acutely O
cytotoxic O
therapeutic O
antibody. O
Epratuzumab O
has O
distinct O
effects O
on O
cell O
growth O
from O
rituximab. O
For O
example, O
rituximab+anti-human O
IgG B-GENE-N
Fcgamma I-GENE-N
yielded O
marked O
inhibition O
of O
proliferation O
in O
human O
NHL O
cell O

lines, O
while O
epratuzumab O
had O
little O
or O
no O
effect O
in O
this O
assay. O
However, O
when O
cells O
were O
immobilized O
and O
stimulated O
with O
anti-IgM, B-GENE-N
epratuzumab, O
but O
not O
rituximab, O
caused O
a O
significant O
antiproliferative O
effect. O
Unlike O
rituximab, O
no O
CDC O
could O
be O
detected, O
and O
ADCC O
was O
modest O
but O
significant O
with O
epratuzumab. O
Importantly, O
combining O
rituximab O
and O
epratuzumab O
did O
not O
decrease O
rituximab's O
ability O
to O
induce O
apoptosis, O

CDC, O
and O
ADCC. O
In O
fact, O
the O
combination O
is O
more O
effective O
than O
rituximab O
alone O
in O
inhibiting O
proliferation O
of O
Daudi O
Burkitt O
lymphoma O
cells O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
second O
antibody, O
and O
at O
least O
equally O
effective O
to O
rituximab O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
crosslinking. O
These O
observations O
suggest O
that O
it O
may O
be O
possible O
to O
enhance O
clinical O
efficacy O
by O
combination O
therapy O
comprised O
of O

Vasopressin B-GENE-Y

a O

Fluid O

the O

However, O
fluid O
restriction O
may O
be O
very O
difficult O
for O
patients O
to O

is O
slow O

More O
efficient O

specific O
treatments O
of O
hyponatremia O
are O
needed. O
In O
this O

pharmacologic O
research O
has O
yielded O
a O
number O
of O
compounds O

Previously, O
we O
reported O
that O
l-glutamic B-CHEMICAL
acid I-CHEMICAL
decarboxylase I-GENE-Y
isoform I-GENE-Y
65 I-GENE-Y
(GAD65) B-GENE-Y
could O
be O
cleaved O
in O

to O
release O
a O

stable O

which O
lacks O
amino B-CHEMICAL
acid I-CHEMICAL

from O
the O
N-terminus, B-CHEMICAL
GAD65(Delta1-69). B-GENE-Y
However, O
whether O
such O
a O
truncated O
form O
is O
also O
present O
under O
certain O
physiological O
conditions O
remains O
elusive. O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
showed O
that, O
upon O
sustained O

stimulation, O
GAD65 B-GENE-Y
could O
be O
cleaved O
into O
a O
truncated O
form O
in O
a O

preparation. O
This O
truncated O
form O
had O
similar O
electrophoretic O
mobility O
to O
purified O
recombinant O
human B-GENE-Y
GAD65(Delta1-69). I-GENE-Y
Furthermore, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
this O
conversion O
was O
calcium B-CHEMICAL

and O
1,2-bis-(o-aminphenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic B-CHEMICAL
acid I-CHEMICAL
tetra-acetoxy-methyl I-CHEMICAL
ester I-CHEMICAL
prevented O
the O
cleavage O
of O
GAD65. B-GENE-Y
In O
addition, O
our O
data O
suggested O
that O
calpain, B-GENE-N
a O
calcium-dependent B-CHEMICAL
cysteine B-CHEMICAL
protease, I-GENE-N
is O
activated O
upon O
neuronal O
stimulation O
and O
could O
be O
responsible O
for O
the O
conversion O
of O
full-length O
GAD65 B-GENE-Y
to O
truncated O
GAD65 B-GENE-Y
in O
the O

brain. O
Moreover, O
calpain B-GENE-N
inhibitors O
such O
as O

or O

could O
block O
the O

BACKGROUND O
AND O
PURPOSE: O
The O
cardiovascular O
benefits O
of O

often O
attributed O
to O
the O
antioxidant O

of O
its O
polyphenolic O
constituents, O
including O
quercetin, B-CHEMICAL
catechin B-CHEMICAL
and O
resveratrol. B-CHEMICAL
Inhibition O
of O
cardiac O
voltage-gated B-GENE-N
sodium I-GENE-N
channels I-GENE-N
(VGSCs) B-GENE-N
is O
antiarrhythmic O
and O

cardioprotective. O
As O
polyphenols O
may O
also O
modulate O
ion O
channels, O
and O
possess O
structural O
similarities O
to O
several O
antiarrhythmic O
VGSC B-GENE-N
inhibitors, O
we O
hypothesised O
that O
VGSC B-GENE-N
inhibition O
may O
contribute O
to O
cardioprotection O
by O
these O
polyphenols. O
EXPERIMENTAL O
APPROACH: O
The O

(NSAID) O
with O
Helicobacter O

Helicobacter O
pylori O
(H. O

and O
non-steroidal B-CHEMICAL

anti-inflammatory O
drugs O
(NSAID) O
are O
major O
pathogenic O
factors O
in O
peptic O

but O
whether O
these O
two O
factors O
exert O
synergistic O
or O
antagonistic O
action O
on O
the O
gastric O
mucosa O
has O
been O
a O
subject O
of O
controversy. O
The O
classic O
concept O
states O
that O
there O
is O
an O
increased O
ulcer O
occurrence O
and O
bleeding O
in O
patients O
with O
both O
H. O

NSAID O
use. O
However, O
the O
question O
whether O
the O
H. O

eradication O
therapy O
in O
NSAID O
users O
reduces O
the O
occurrence O

Studies O
on O

NSAID-associated O
ulcers O
in O
H. O

patients O
have O
indicated O
that O
H. O

in O
impaired O
ulcer O

with O
an O
effect O
on O
the O
rate O

On O
the O

the O

of O
H. O

in O
patients O
with O
no O
prior O
history O

chronic O
NSAID O
therapy O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
decrease O
the O

of O
peptic O

Studies O
in O
experimental O

revealed O
for O

that O
the O
H. O

infection O
augments O
the O
gastric O

induced O
by O
NSAID O
in O
Mongolian O

on O
ulcerogenesis. O
Accumulated O
evidence O
in O
humans O

shows O
that O
both O
aspirin B-CHEMICAL

H. O

upregulate O
the O

cyclooxygenase B-GENE-N
(COX)-2 I-GENE-N
both O
at O

at O
the O

but O
failed O
to O
influence O
significantly O
that O

It O
was, O
therefore, O
proposed O
that O
H. O

may O
in O
fact, O
antagonize, O
aspirin-induced B-CHEMICAL

due O

We O

Because O

we O

Phospholipase B-GENE-Y
Cgamma1 I-GENE-Y

by O
forming O
a O
ternary O
complex O
with O
Jak2 B-GENE-Y
and O
protein B-GENE-Y
tyrosine B-CHEMICAL
phosphatase-1B. I-GENE-Y
Growth B-GENE-Y
hormone I-GENE-Y
binds O
to O
its O

membrane O
receptor O
(GHR), B-GENE-Y
whereby O
it O
regulates O
many O
cellular O
functions, O
including O
proliferation, O

and O
chemotaxis. O
However, O
although O
the O
activation O
of O

is O
well O
understood, O
the O
precise O
mechanism O

has O
not O
been O
elucidated. O
Here, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
phospholipase B-GENE-Y
Cgamma1 I-GENE-Y
(PLCgamma1) B-GENE-Y
modulates O
the O
action O
of O
growth B-GENE-Y
hormone-mediated I-GENE-Y

In O

(PLCgamma1(-/-)), B-GENE-Y

JAK2 B-GENE-Y
and O

phosphorylation O
significantly O
increased O
in O
mouse O

(MEFs). O
Furthermore, O
the O
re-expression O
of O
PLCgamma1 B-GENE-Y
reduced O
growth B-GENE-Y

Jak2 B-GENE-Y
activation. O
Growth B-GENE-Y
hormone-induced I-GENE-Y
Jak2 B-GENE-Y
phosphorylation O
was O
enhanced O
by O
siRNA-specific O

Interestingly, O
PLCgamma1 B-GENE-Y
physically O

(PTP-1B) B-GENE-N
by O

both O

different O

and O
this O
process O
was O
implicated O
in O
the O
modulation O

In O
addition, O
in O
PLCgamma1(-/-) B-GENE-Y
MEFs, O
growth B-GENE-Y
hormone-dependent I-GENE-Y
c-Fos B-GENE-Y
activation O
was O
upregulated O
and O
growth B-GENE-Y
hormone-induced I-GENE-Y

potentiated. O
These O
results O

that O
PLCgamma1 B-GENE-Y
has O
a O
key O
function O
in O
the O
regulation O
of O
growth B-GENE-Y

The O

unclear. O

partly O
due O

METHODS: O

RESULTS: O
No O

Overall, O
no O

Among O

Herein, O

this O

In O

Thus, O

We O

that O

These O

We O

Finally, O
we O

The O

In O
this O

we O

using O
14 O

In O

no O

The O
goal O
here O

the O
murine, B-GENE-N

INTRODUCTION: O
It O
is O
well O
known O
that O
numerous O
mechanisms O
of O
thrombogenesis O
can O
participate O
in O
every O
stage O
of O
atherosclerotic O

The O
discovery O
of O
Lp(a) B-GENE-Y

and O
its O
structural O

suggests O

thrombogenesis. O
SOME O
CHARACTERISTICS O
OF O
LP(A) B-GENE-Y
LIPOPROTEIN: B-GENE-N
This O
lipoprotein O
is O
present O
in O
the O
whole O
human O
population O
in O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
plasma O
concentrations. O
It O
has O
numerous O
different O
isoforms. O
Its O
synthesis O
occurs O
in O
the O
liver, O
but O
it O
is O
practically O
metabolically O
independent O
from O
other O
lipoproteins. B-GENE-N
Today, O
Lp(a) B-GENE-Y
lipoprotein B-GENE-N
is O
considered O
to O
be O
an O
independent O
risk O
factor O
for O
heart O
and O
brain O
ischemic O
disease. O
FIBRINOLYTIC O
MECHANISMS: O
The O
primary O
role O
of O
the O

fibrinolytic O
mechanism O
is O
to O
prevent O
thrombus O
Jormation O
during O
circulation O
and O
to O
remove O
already O
formed O
ones. O
Plasmin B-GENE-Y
has O
a O
central O
role O
in O
this O
process, O
due O
to O
the O
inactive O
proenzyme O
plasminogen. B-GENE-Y
Its O
basic O
activators O
are O
tissue-type B-GENE-Y
plasminogen I-GENE-Y
activator I-GENE-Y
(t-PA) B-GENE-Y
and O
urokinase B-GENE-Y
plasminogen I-GENE-Y
activator I-GENE-Y
(u-PA). B-GENE-Y
The O
most O
important O
inhibitors O
of O
plasminogen B-GENE-Y
are O
alpha2-antiplasmin B-GENE-Y
and O
plasminogen B-GENE-N
activator I-GENE-N
inhibitors I-GENE-N
1 I-GENE-N
and I-GENE-N
2 I-GENE-N
(PA-1 B-GENE-Y
and O

PAI-2). B-GENE-Y
Structural O
similarity O
of O
Lp(a) B-GENE-Y
and O
plasminogen B-GENE-Y
The O
apo(a) B-GENE-N
and O
plasminogen B-GENE-Y
genes O
are O
very O
closely O
linked O
on O
the O
long O
arm O
of O
chromosome O
6. O
Because O
of O
that O
they O
are O
structuraly O
very O
similar O
and O
they O
have O
a O
cross O
immunological O
reactivity. O
Their O
common O
elements O
are O
so-called O
"kringle" O
structures. O
The O
key O
difference O
in O
structure O
of O
Lp(a) B-GENE-Y
and O
plasminogen B-GENE-Y
is O
replacement O
of O
Arg B-CHEMICAL
with O
Ser B-CHEMICAL
at O
position O
560. O
This O
prevents O
splitting O
of O
apo(a) B-GENE-N
by O
plasminogen B-GENE-N
activators. I-GENE-N

LP(A) B-GENE-Y
AND O
FIBRINOLYSIS: O
Lp(a) B-GENE-Y
lipoprotein B-GENE-N
inhibits O
activation O
of O
plasminogen B-GENE-Y
by O
streptokinase. B-GENE-N
It O
is O
also O
a O
competitive O
inhibitor O
of O
plasminogen B-GENE-Y
for O
its O
binding O
to O
plasminogen B-GENE-N
receptors. I-GENE-N
Furthermore, O
it O
successfully O
achieves O
competitive O
inhibition O
of O
plasminogen B-GENE-Y
for O
binding O
to O
tetranectin B-GENE-Y
and O
thrombospondin. B-GENE-Y
Also, O
Lp(a) B-GENE-Y
inhibits O
activation O
of O
transforming B-GENE-Y
growth I-GENE-Y
factor I-GENE-Y
alpha I-GENE-Y
(TGF-alpha). B-GENE-Y
It O
positively O
correlates O
with O
PAI-1 B-GENE-Y
and O
it O

is O
assumed O
that O
it O
promotes O
release O
of O
tissue B-GENE-Y
factor I-GENE-Y
pathway O
inhibitor O
(17FPI) O
from O
endothelial O
cell O
surfaces. O
CONCLUSION: O
In O
regulation O

the O

Irbesartan B-CHEMICAL

In O

Thus, O

Because O

Thymidylate B-CHEMICAL

To O

this O
is O
the O
first O
demonstration O
in O

The O

The O

Because O

these O

indicate O
that O

in O
many O

Recently, O
we O

In O

that O
ibuprofen B-CHEMICAL
reduces O

Here, O
we O

that O

Moreover, O
the O

BACKGROUND: O

CONCLUSION: O

teratogenicity. O
Half O
a O
century O
ago, O
thalidomide B-CHEMICAL
was O
widely O
prescribed O
to O
pregnant O
women O
as O
a O
sedative O
but O
was O
found O
to O

be O
teratogenic, O
causing O
multiple O

defects. O
Today, O
thalidomide B-CHEMICAL
is O
still O
used O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
leprosy O
and O
multiple O

although O
how O
it O
causes O
limb O

and O
other O
developmental O

is O
unknown. O
Here, O
we O
identified O
cereblon B-GENE-N
(CRBN) B-GENE-N
as O
a O
thalidomide-binding B-CHEMICAL
protein. I-GENE-N
CRBN B-GENE-N

Thalidomide B-CHEMICAL
initiates O
its O
teratogenic O
effects O
by O
binding O
to O
CRBN B-GENE-N
and O
inhibiting O
the O
associated O
ubiquitin B-GENE-N
ligase I-GENE-N
activity. O
This O
study O
reveals O
a O
basis O
for O
thalidomide B-CHEMICAL
teratogenicity O
and O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
development O
of O

In O
this O

we O
explore O
the O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
a O

(E59D/D75Y) B-GENE-N
in O

cardiac B-GENE-Y

associated O
with O

Studying O
the O
single O
mutants O
(i.e. O
E59D B-GENE-N
or O
D75Y) B-GENE-N
indicates O
that O
D75Y, B-GENE-N
but O
not O
E59D, B-GENE-N
causes O
a O

However, O
both O
D75Y B-GENE-N
and O

E59D B-GENE-N
are O
required O
to O
reduce O
the O
actomyosin B-GENE-N

and O
maximal O

in O

indicating O
that O
E59D B-GENE-N
enhances O
the O
effects O
of O
D75Y. B-GENE-N
Part O
of O
the O
reduction O
in O
force/ATPase B-GENE-N
may O
be O
due O
to O
a O
defect O
in O
the O
interactions O
between O
CTnC B-GENE-Y
and O
cardiac B-GENE-Y
troponin I-GENE-Y
T, I-GENE-Y
which O
are O
known O
to O
be O
necessary O
for O
ATPase B-GENE-N
activation. O
An O
additional O
mechanism O
for O
the O
reduction O
in O
force/ATPase B-GENE-N
comes O
from O
measurements O
of O
the O
binding O
stoichiometry O
of O
myosin B-GENE-N

to O

Using O

with O

the O

23% O

Altogether, O
these O
results O

that O
the O

is O
possibly O
due O

Alcohol B-CHEMICAL
has O
been O
consistently O

thus O
we O
hoped O

Despite O

eventually O
develop O

It O
has O
been O

that O
in O

cells, O
the O
ER B-GENE-N
is O
expressed O

continues O
to O
regulate O

Recent O
studies O
indicate O
that O
tamoxifen B-CHEMICAL
initially O
acts O
as O
an O

but O
later O
functions O
as O
an O
ER B-GENE-N

promoting O

This O
suggests O
that O

provide O
an O
effective O
therapeutic O
approach O
for O
breast O
cancers, O
even O
those O
that O

With O
this O
in O

we O
previously O
demonstrated O
that O

effectively O
induce O

Herein O
we O
further O
refined O
the O
PROTAC O
approach O
to O
target O
the O

for O

The O

thereby O
recruiting O
the O
ER B-GENE-N
to O
this O
E3 B-GENE-N
ligase I-GENE-N
for O

Specifically, O
the O
pentapeptide O
is O
attached O
at O
three O

locations O
on O

generate O
three O

With O

BACKGROUND O
AND O
PURPOSE: O
There O

(the O
ability O

Ligands O

In O

it O

KEY O
RESULTS: O
Several O
agonists O
were O
found O
to O
be O
highly O

because O
of O
selective O

(e.g. O

(e.g. O

However, O
the O
intrinsic O

of O
salmeterol, B-CHEMICAL

Several O

BACKGROUND: O
We O
describe O
a O
rare O
case O
of O
congenital O
hypothyroidism O
and O
an O
extremely O
high O
serum O
thyrotropin B-GENE-N
(TSH) B-GENE-N
level O
caused O
by O
a O
combination O
of O
resistance O
to O
thyroid O
hormone O
(RTH) O
and O
a O
lingual O
thyroid. O
As O
the O
RTH O
mutant, O
R316C, B-GENE-N
was O
new, O
the O
optimum O
dose O
of O
levothyroxine B-CHEMICAL
was O
unclear. O
To O
aid O
in O
assessment O
of O
the O
therapy, O
we O
characterized O
the O
mutant O
R316C B-GENE-N
thyroid B-GENE-N
hormone I-GENE-N
receptor I-GENE-N
(TR) B-GENE-N
and O
compared O
it O
with O
a O
common O
mutant, O
R316H, B-GENE-N

using O
in O

studies. O
SUMMARY: O
The O
patient O
was O
a O
newborn O
female O
having O
severe O
hypothyroidism O
with O
a O
free O
thyroxine B-CHEMICAL
level O
of O
0.36 O
ng/dL O
and O
a O
serum O
TSH B-GENE-N
level O
of O
177 O
microU/mL. O
A O
scintiscan O
showed O
ectopic O
lingual O
thyroid O
tissue O
without O
a O
normal O
thyroid O
gland. O
Supplementation O
with O
levothyroxine B-CHEMICAL
at O
a O
dose O
of O
>350 O
microg/day O
did O
not O
normalize O
the O
serum O
TSH B-GENE-N
level; O
however, O
the O
patient O
showed O
normal O
growth O
and O
intelligence O
at O
14 O
years O

of O
age. O
Consistent O
with O
the O
results O
of O
a O
computer O
analysis, O
the O
binding O
of O
R316C B-GENE-N
to O
triiodothyronine B-CHEMICAL
(T3) B-CHEMICAL
was O
significantly O
decreased O
to O
38% O
that O
of O
the O
wild O
type. O
Electrophoretic O
mobility O
shift O
assay O
demonstrated O
that O
like O
R316H, B-GENE-N
R316C B-GENE-N
did O
not O
form O
a O
homodimer, O
but O
formed O
a O
heterodimer O
with O
RXR. B-GENE-N
However, O
a O
glutathione-S-transferase B-CHEMICAL
pull-down O
assay O
showed O
reduced O
binding O
of O
R316C B-GENE-N
with O
NCoR B-GENE-Y
in O
the O
absence O
of O
T3 B-CHEMICAL
and O
impaired O
release O

in O
the O
presence O
of O
T3. B-CHEMICAL
In O
addition, O
transient O
transfection O
experiments O
demonstrated O
that O
unlike O
R316H, B-GENE-N
R316C B-GENE-N
had O
severe O
impairment O
of O
transcriptional O
activity O
on O
genes O
both O
positively O
and O
negatively O
regulated O
by O
thyroid O
hormone. O
It O
also O
had O
a O
clear O
dominant O
negative O
effect O
on O
genes O
negatively, O
but O
not O
positively, O
regulated O
by O
thyroid O
hormone, O
including O
the O
TSH-releasing B-GENE-Y
hormone I-GENE-Y
and O
TSHbeta B-GENE-Y
genes. O
CONCLUSION: O
This O
is O
the O
first O
reported O
case O
of O
a O
R316C B-GENE-N
TR B-GENE-N
mutation. O
The O
characteristics O
of O
the O
R316C B-GENE-N
mutant O
differed O
from O
those O
of O
the O

R316H B-GENE-N
mutant. O
Our O
findings O
suggest O
that O
R316C B-GENE-N
causes O
reduced O
association O
with O
and O
impaired O
release O
of O
NCoR, B-GENE-Y
resulting O
in O
RTH O
predominantly O
at O
the O
pituitary O
level, O
and O
that O
slightly O
elevated O
serum O
TSH B-GENE-N
level O
with O
high O
dose O
of O
levothyroxine B-CHEMICAL
might O
be O
optimum O
for O
normal O
growth. O

BACKGROUND O
AND O
PURPOSE: O
Most O
patients O
with O
cancer O
die O
not O
because O
of O
the O
tumour O
in O
the O
primary O
site, O
but O
because O
it O
has O
spread O
to O
other O
sites. O
Common O
tumours, O
such O
as O

breast, O
multiple O
myeloma, O
and O
prostate O
tumours, O
frequently O
metastasize O
to O
the O
bone. O
To O
search O
for O
an O
inhibitor O
of O
cancer-induced O
bone O
loss, O
we O
investigated O
the O
effect O
of O
thiocolchicoside, B-CHEMICAL
a O
semi-synthetic O
colchicoside B-CHEMICAL
derived O
from O
the O
plant O
Gloriosa O

and O
clinically O

of I-GENE-Y
NF-kappaB I-GENE-Y

and O
tumour O

EXPERIMENTAL O
APPROACH: O
We O
used O

RAW O
264.7 O
(murine O
macrophage) O
cells, O
a O
well-established O
system O
for O
osteoclastogenesis, O

KEY O
RESULTS: O
Thiocolchicoside B-CHEMICAL
suppressed O
osteoclastogenesis O
induced O
by O
RANKL, B-GENE-Y
and O
by O
breast O
cancer O
and O
multiple O
myeloma O
cells. O
Inhibition O
of O
the O

NF-kappaB B-GENE-N
pathway O
was O
responsible O
for O
this O
effect O
since O
the O
colchicoside B-CHEMICAL
inhibited O
RANKL-induced B-GENE-Y
NF-kappaB B-GENE-N
activation, O
activation O
of O
IkappaB B-GENE-N

(IKK) B-GENE-N
and O
suppressed O

NF-kappaBalpha B-GENE-Y
(IkappaBalpha) B-GENE-Y
phosphorylation O
and O
degradation, O
an O
inhibitor O
of O
NF-kappaB. B-GENE-N
Furthermore, O
an O
inhibitor O
of O
the O
IkappaBalpha B-GENE-Y
kinase B-GENE-N
gamma O
or O
NF-kappaB B-GENE-N
essential O
modulator, O
the O
regulatory O
component O
of O
the O
IKK B-GENE-N
complex, O
demonstrated O
that O
the O

NF-kappaB B-GENE-N
signalling O
pathway O
is O
mandatory O
for O
osteoclastogenesis O
induced O
by O
RANKL. B-GENE-Y
CONCLUSIONS O
AND O
IMPLICATIONS: O
Together, O
these O
data O
suggest O
that O
thiocolchicoside B-CHEMICAL
significantly O
suppressed O
osteoclastogenesis O
induced O
by O
RANKL B-GENE-Y
and O
tumour O
cells O
via O
the O
NF-kappaB B-GENE-N

Thus, O
thiocolchicoside, B-CHEMICAL
a O
drug O
that O
has O
been O
used O
for O
almost O
half O
a O

treat O

their O

We O
have O
examined O
the O
effectiveness O

two O
novel O
Chk1 B-GENE-Y

and O
AR678, B-CHEMICAL
in O

We O
demonstrate O
that O
these O
drugs O
display O
single-agent O
activity, O
with O
IC50s O
in O
the O

range. O
The O
drugs O
produce O
cytotoxic O

are O
only O
sensitive O
to O
these O
drugs O
at O
the O
higher O
concentrations O
where O
they O
have O
cytostatic O
activity. O
The O
cytotoxic O
effect O
is O
the O
consequence O
of O
inhibition O

Chk1, B-GENE-Y
which O
drives O

in O
either O

The O
sensitivity O

the O
Chk1 B-GENE-Y

was O
correlated O
with O
the O
level O

are O
viable O

a O
critical O

As O

No O

These O

Furthermore, O

All O
these O

In O
the O

we O
evaluated O
the O

After O

while O

In O

Compared O

whereas O
the O

While O

In O
conclusion, O
these O

that O

Through O

we O
are O

the O

In O

the O

It O
is O

are O
also O

A O
less O

equally O
important O
aspect O

(TRAIL) B-GENE-Y
is O
one O
of O

therapeutics. O
However, O
resistance O
to O
TRAIL B-GENE-Y

remains O
a O
current O
problem O
in O
recent. O
The O
protein-folding O

(ER) O
is O
particularly O

which, O

Therefore, O
we O

TRAIL-induced B-GENE-Y

in O
cancer O

We O
first O
found O
that O
VA O
induces O

Importantly, O
the O
transient O

using O

for O
CHOP B-GENE-Y
abrogated O
VA-induced O
DR5 B-GENE-Y

and O
attenuated O

Treatment O

also O
increased O
the O

Furthermore, O
salubrinal, B-CHEMICAL
a O

agent, O
increased O
CHOP B-GENE-Y

in O
the O
presence O
of O
VA. O
In O
contrast, O

significantly O
reversed O

apoptosis O
with O
downregulation O
of O

Therefore, O
VA-induced O
eIF2α B-GENE-Y
phosphorylation O
seemed O
to O
be O
important O
for O
CHOP B-GENE-Y

Aging O

thereby O

Conversely, O

Moreover, O
pharmacological O

These O

that O

The O
limited O
availability O
and O
administration O
of O
multiple O
doses O
of O
this O
stoichiometric O

make O
this O

difficult. O
Thus, O
the O
goal O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
produce O
a O
smaller O
enzymatically O

HuBChE B-GENE-Y
polypeptide O
(HBP) O
that O
could O
bind O

Studies O

the O

are O
also O
essential O
for O
the O

Therefore, O
we O
designed O
three O
HBPs O
by O
deleting O
some O
N- O

C-terminal O
residues O
of O
HuBChE B-GENE-Y

BChE B-GENE-Y

was O
used O
as O
a O

The O
cDNAs O

the O
HBPs O

were O
synthesized, O
cloned O
into O
different O
mammalian O

polypeptides O
were O
transiently O
expressed O

No O

the O
newly O

Only O
enzymatically O

was O
secreted O
into O

These O
results O
suggest O
that O

are O
required O
for O
the O

The O

Taken O

our O

that O
the O

In O

The O

In O

Here O

However, O
the O
analysis O
of O
a O

demonstrates O
that O
this O

does O
not O
originate O
from O
a O

Using O

we O
performed O
a O

genetic O

During O

this O

Mutant O

Consistent O
with O

animals O
are O

This O
latter O

in O

Surprisingly, O

not O
accompanied O

but O
by O
reduced O

This O
suggests O
that O
the O

In O

Results: O
Of O
the O

The O

were O
considerably O
lower O

the O

In O

However, O

that O
the O

which O

the O
explanation O
why O

These O

that O

The O

an O

Further O

the O

A O

that O
the O

Our O

in O
lipopolysaccharide O

which O
catalpol B-CHEMICAL

To O
further O
investigate O
the O
protective O
effect O
and O

mechanism O
of O
catalpol, B-CHEMICAL
astrocytes O
were O
pretreated O

for O

Biochemical O
analyses O
showed O
that O
NO B-CHEMICAL
and O
ROS O

and O
iNOS B-GENE-Y
activity O
were O
significantly O
reduced O
by O
catalpol. B-CHEMICAL
Data O
at O
transcriptional O

also O
demonstrated O
that O
catalpol B-CHEMICAL
potently O
attenuated O
gene O
expressions O
involved O
in O
inflammation, O
such O
as O
iNOS, B-GENE-Y
COX-2 B-GENE-Y
and O
TLR4. B-GENE-Y
In O
addition, O
our O

exploration O
further O
revealed O
that O
the O
suppressive O
action O
of O
catalpol B-CHEMICAL
on O
inflammation O
was O
mediated O
via O
inhibiting O
nuclear B-GENE-N
factor-κB I-GENE-N
(NF-κB) B-GENE-N
activation. O
Collectively, O
these O
results O
suggest O
that O
catalpol B-CHEMICAL
can O
exert O
inhibitory O
effects O
on O
the O
inflammatory O
reaction O
in O
astrocytes O
and O
that O
inactivation O
of O
NF-κB B-GENE-N
could O
be O
the O
major O
determinant O
for O
its O
anti-inflammatory O
mechanism. O
Therefore, O
catalpol B-CHEMICAL
may O
potentially O
be O
a O
highly O
effective O
therapeutic O
agent O
in O
treating O
neurodegenerative O

associated O

Further O

Both O

In O
conclusion, O
although O

only O
on O
tightly O

cardiolipin, B-CHEMICAL
tetramer O

required O

This O
is O

The O

Arsenic B-CHEMICAL

protein. O
Transcription B-GENE-Y
factor I-GENE-Y
p63, I-GENE-Y
a O
member O
of O
the O
p53 B-GENE-Y
family, O
shares O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
sequence O
similarity O
with O
p53. B-GENE-Y
Because O
of O
transcription O
from O
two O
distinct O
promoters, O
the O
p63 B-GENE-N
gene O
encodes O
two O
isoforms, O
TAp63 B-GENE-Y
and O
ΔNp63. B-GENE-Y
Although O
TAp63 B-GENE-Y
acts O
as O
a O
tumor O
suppressor, O
ΔNp63 B-GENE-Y
functions O
as O
an O
oncogene O
and O
is O
often O
overexpressed O
in O
squamous O
cell O
carcinomas. O
Thus, O
therapeutic O
agents O
targeting O

ΔNp63 B-GENE-Y
might O
be O
used O
to O
manage O
tumors O
that O
overexpress O
ΔNp63. B-GENE-Y
Here O
we O
found O
that O
arsenic B-CHEMICAL
trioxide, I-CHEMICAL
a O
frontline O
agent O
for O
acute O
promyelocytic O
leukemia, O
inhibits O
ΔNp63 B-GENE-Y
but O
not O
TAp63 B-GENE-Y
expression O
in O
time- O
and O
dose-dependent O
manners. O
In O
addition, O
we O
found O
that O
arsenic B-CHEMICAL
trioxide I-CHEMICAL
decreases O
the O
stability O
of O
ΔNp63 B-GENE-Y
protein O
via O
a O
proteasome-dependent B-GENE-N
pathway O
but O
has O
little O
effect O
on O
the O
level O
of O
ΔNp63 B-GENE-Y
transcript. O
Furthermore, O
we O
found O
that O

arsenic B-CHEMICAL
trioxide I-CHEMICAL
activates O
the O
Pirh2 B-GENE-N
promoter I-GENE-N
and O
consequently O
induces O
Pirh2 B-GENE-Y
expression. O
Consistent O
with O
this, O
we O
found O
that O
knockdown O
of O
Pirh2 B-GENE-Y
inhibits, O
whereas O
ectopic O
expression O
of O
Pirh2 B-GENE-Y
enhances, O
arsenic-induced B-CHEMICAL
degradation O
of O
ΔNp63 B-GENE-Y
protein. O
Importantly, O
we O
found O
that O
knockdown O
of O
ΔNp63 B-GENE-Y
sensitizes, O
whereas O
ectopic O
expression O
of O
ΔNp63 B-GENE-Y
inhibits, O
growth O

induced O
by O
arsenic. B-CHEMICAL
Together, O
these O
data O
suggest O
that O
arsenic B-CHEMICAL

degrades O
ΔNp63 B-GENE-Y
protein O
at O
least O
in O
part O
via O
Pirh2-dependent B-GENE-Y

and O
that O

over O

(VKAs) O
due O

have O
important O
limitations O
that O

these O

such O

This O
may O
lead O

Both O

little O

minimal O
inter-patient O

and O
display O

similar O
pharmacokinetics O
in O

Since O
both O
are O

co-administration O
of O
rivaroxaban B-CHEMICAL

apixaban B-CHEMICAL
with O
strong O
cytochrome B-GENE-Y

inhibitors O

can O
result O
in O
substantial O
changes O
in O
plasma O

due O
to O

consequently, O
their O
concomitant O

and O
caution O
is O
required O
when O
used O
concomitantly O
with O
strong O
CYP3A4 B-GENE-Y

Although O
parenteral O
oral O
direct O

thrombin B-GENE-Y

(DTIs), O
such O
as O
argatroban B-CHEMICAL
and O
bivalirudin, O
have O
been O
on O
the O
market O
for O
years, O
DTIs O
such O
as O
dabigatran B-CHEMICAL
are O
novel O
synthetic O
thrombin B-GENE-Y

Dabigatran B-CHEMICAL
etexilate I-CHEMICAL
is O
a O
low-molecular-weight O
non-active O
pro-drug O
that O
is O
administered O
orally O
and O
converted O
rapidly O
to O
its O
active O
form, O
dabigatran--a B-CHEMICAL
potent, O
competitive O
and O
reversible O
DTI. O
Dabigatran B-CHEMICAL
has O
an O
advantage O
over O
the O
indirect O
thrombin B-GENE-Y
inhibitors, O
unfractionated O
heparin O

low-molecular-weight O
heparin, O
in O
that O
it O
inhibits O

fibrin-bound B-GENE-N

The O
reversible O
binding O
of O
dabigatran B-CHEMICAL
may O
provide O
safer O

more O
predictable O
anticoagulant O
treatment O
than O
seen O
with O
irreversible, O
non-covalent O
thrombin B-GENE-Y
inhibitors, O
e.g. O
hirudin. O
Dabigatran B-CHEMICAL
shows O
a O
very O
low O
potential O
for O
drug-drug O

However, O
co-administration O
of O
dabigatran B-CHEMICAL
etexilate I-CHEMICAL
with O
other O
anticoagulants O
and O
antiplatelet O
agents O
can O
increase O
the O

Although O
the O

are O

pharmacologically O
better O
than O
VKAs--particularly O
in O
terms O
of O
fixed O

rapid O

action, O
no O
INR O
monitoring O
and O
lower O
risk O
of O
drug O
interactions--there O
are O
some O
differences O
between O
them: O
the O
bioavailability O
of O
dabigatran B-CHEMICAL
is O
lower O
than O
rivaroxaban B-CHEMICAL
and O
apixaban, B-CHEMICAL
and O
so O
the O
dabigatran B-CHEMICAL
dosage O
required O
is O
higher; O
lower O
protein O
binding O
of O
dabigatran B-CHEMICAL
reduces O
the O
variability O
related O
to O
albuminaemia. O
The O
risk O
of O
metabolic O
drug-drug O
interactions O
also O
appears O
to O
differ O
between O
OACs: O
VKAs O
> O
rivaroxaban B-CHEMICAL

apixaban B-CHEMICAL

dabigatran. B-CHEMICAL
The O

The O

However, O
some O

A O

Furthermore, O

modulate O
the O

current O

Nonalcoholic O
fatty O
liver O
disease O
(NAFLD) O
is O
considered O
the O
most O
common O
liver O
disorder O
in O
the O
Western O
world. O
It O
is O
commonly O
associated O
with O
insulin B-GENE-Y
resistance, O
obesity, O
dyslipidaemia, O
type O
2 O
diabetes O
mellitus O
(T2DM) O
and O
cardiovascular O
disease. O
Nonalcoholic O
steatohepatitis O
(NASH) O
is O
characterized O
by O
steatosis O
with O

necroinflammation O
and O
eventual O
fibrosis, O
which O
can O
lead O
to O
end-stage O
liver O
disease O
and O
hepatocellular O

Its O
pathogenesis O
is O
complex, O
and O
involves O
a O
state O
of O
'lipotoxicity' O
in O
which O
insulin B-GENE-Y
resistance, O
with O
increased O

play O
a O
key O

in O
the O
onset O
of O
a O
'lipotoxic O

and O
its O
progression O
to O
NASH. O
The O
diagnosis O

is O
challenging, O
as O
most O

and O
the O
role O

and O
liver O
ultrasound O
are O
helpful O
in O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
NAFLD/NASH, O
but O
a O
liver O

is O
often O
required O
for O
a O
definitive O
diagnosis. O
However, O
there O
is O
an O
active O

that O
may O
non-invasively O
aid O

The O

requires O
a O
multifaceted O
approach. O
The O
goal O
is O
to O
reverse O
obesity-associated O
lipotoxicity O
and O
insulin B-GENE-Y
resistance O
via O
lifestyle O
intervention. O
Although O
there O

Quercetin-loaded B-CHEMICAL

Quercetin B-CHEMICAL
(1) O
is O
an O
anti-inflammatory O

flavonoid. B-CHEMICAL
However, O
the O
oral O

not O
lead O
to O
beneficial O
effects O
in O
experimental O
animal O
colitis O
models, O
which O

cytokines B-GENE-N

stress. O
A O
possible O
explanation O
is O
that O
the O

absorption O
profile O
of O
1 O
prevents O
its O
activity. O
Therefore, O
it O
was O
reasoned O
that O
the O
controlled O
release O
of O
1 O
would O
improve O
its O
therapeutic O
effect. O
Thus, O
the O
therapeutic O
effect O
and O
mechanisms O
of O
1-loaded O
microcapsules O
in O

Microcapsules O

The O
oral O
administration O

1-loaded O
microcapsules O
decreased O
neutrophil O

reduced O

and O
IL-1β B-GENE-Y
and O
IL-33 B-GENE-Y
production O
in O
the O

Microcapsules O
loaded O
with O
1 O
also O
prevented O
the O
reduction O
of O
anti-inflammatory O
cytokine B-GENE-N
IL-10 B-GENE-Y
and O
the O
antioxidant O
capacity O
of O
the O
colon. O
These O
preclinical O
data O
indicate O
that O
pectin/casein B-GENE-N
polymer O
microcapsules O
loaded O

1 O
improved O
the O
anti-inflammatory O
and O
antioxidant O
effects O
of O

Therefore, O

The O

which O

A O

However, O
these O

it O
is O
now O
a O
well-accepted O
fact O
that O

This O
renders O
the O
understanding O

an O
important O
point O

Here, O
we O

which O
is O
known O
to O
act O
synergistically O
with O

in O
melanocytes. O
We O
observed O
that O
MYC B-GENE-Y

the O

Conversely, O

involved O
in O
mediating O

Both, O

The O

on O

However, O
several O
adverse O

have O
been O
noted. O
To O

development O

Here, O
we O
report O
the O

an O

ritodrine-induced B-CHEMICAL

Female O

Ritodrine B-CHEMICAL
significantly O
altered O
the O

steroid B-CHEMICAL

as O

as O
the O

Importantly, O
expression O

the O

amyloid I-GENE-N
A I-GENE-N
(SAA) B-GENE-N
significantly O
increased O
after O

with O
values O
indicating O
the O
largest O
fold-change. O
This O
large O
increase O
in O

SAA B-GENE-N

serves O
as O
a O
more O

than O
conventional O

such O
as O
aspartate B-GENE-Y
aminotransferase I-GENE-Y
and O

aminotransferase. I-GENE-N
The O
increase O
in O
SAA B-GENE-N
expression O
is O
specific O
to O
ritodrine-induced B-CHEMICAL
liver O
damage, O
because O
SAA B-GENE-N
expression O
was O
not O
induced O
by O
other O
hepatotoxic O
drugs O
such O
as O
acetaminophen, B-CHEMICAL
valproic B-CHEMICAL
acid, I-CHEMICAL
or O
metformin. B-CHEMICAL
Our O
in O

studies O
showed O
that O
cyclic B-CHEMICAL
adenosine I-CHEMICAL
3',5'-monophosphate I-CHEMICAL
(cAMP) B-CHEMICAL
accumulation O
was O
not O
a O
primary O
cause O
of O
the O
ritodrine-induced B-CHEMICAL
SAA B-GENE-N
increase. O
Instead, O
SAA B-GENE-N
expression O
was O
enhanced O
by O
indirect O
phosphorylation O
of O
the O
signal B-GENE-Y

transducer I-GENE-Y
and I-GENE-Y
activator I-GENE-Y
of I-GENE-Y
transcription-3 I-GENE-Y

Therefore, O
our O
study O
provides O
a O
method O
for O
sensitive O

early O

of O
hepatic O

and O
may O
thus O

BACKGROUND: O

Recently, O

To O

we O
examined O
the O

Next, O

the O

The O

do O

In O
Siberian O
hamsters, O
exogenous O
ghrelin B-GENE-Y
increases O

similarly O

48-56h O

Therefore, O
we O

the O

Animals O

We O
found O
that O
GO-CoA-Tat O

(0-1h), O

(0-1 O

(0-1h O

2 O

post-refeeding O

This O
suggests O

in O
the O

We O

Insulin B-GENE-Y

These O

CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: O
Experimentally O

hyperinsulinaemia O
is O

Our O
findings O
suggest O
that O
exposure O
to O
a O
GLP-1 B-GENE-Y
during O
hyperglycaemia O
leads O

to O
a O
small O
acute O
increase O
in O
HR O

not O
to O
an O
acute O
decrease O

The O
propeptides O
of O
VEGF-D B-GENE-Y
determine O
heparin O
binding, O
receptor O
heterodimerization, O
and O
effects O
on O
tumor O
biology. O
VEGF-D B-GENE-Y
is O
an O
angiogenic O
and O
lymphangiogenic O
glycoprotein O
that O
can O
be O
proteolytically O
processed O
generating O
various O
forms O
differing O
in O
subunit O
composition O
due O
to O
the O
presence O
or O
absence O
of O
N- B-CHEMICAL
and O
C-terminal B-CHEMICAL
propeptides. O
These O
propeptides O
flank O
the O
central O
VEGF B-GENE-N
homology I-GENE-N
domain, I-GENE-N
that O
contains O
the O
binding O
sites O
for O

VEGF B-GENE-N
receptors I-GENE-N
(VEGFRs), B-GENE-N
but O
their O
biological O
functions O
were O
unclear. O
Characterization O
of O
propeptide O
function O
will O
be O
important O
to O
clarify O
which O
forms O
of O
VEGF-D B-GENE-Y
are O
biologically O
active O
and O
therefore O
clinically O
relevant. O
Here O
we O
use O
VEGF-D B-GENE-Y
mutants O
deficient O
in O
either O
propeptide, O
and O
in O
the O
capacity O
to O
process O
the O
remaining O
propeptide, O
to O
monitor O
the O
functions O
of O
these O
domains. O
We O
report O
for O
the O
first O
time O
that O
VEGF-D B-GENE-Y
binds O
heparin, O
and O
that O
the O
C-terminal B-CHEMICAL
propeptide O
significantly O
enhances O
this O
interaction O
(removal O
of O
this O
propeptide O
from O
full-length O

VEGF-D B-GENE-Y
completely O
prevents O
heparin O
binding). O
We O
also O
show O
that O
removal O
of O
either O
the O
N- B-CHEMICAL
or O
C-terminal B-CHEMICAL
propeptide O
is O
required O
for O
VEGF-D B-GENE-Y
to O
drive O
formation O
of O
VEGFR-2/VEGFR-3 B-GENE-Y
heterodimers O
which O
have O
recently O
been O
shown O
to O
positively O
regulate O
angiogenic O
sprouting. O
The O
mature O
form O
of O
VEGF-D, B-GENE-Y
lacking O
both O
propeptides, O
can O
also O
promote O
formation O
of O
these O
receptor O
heterodimers. O
In O
a O
mouse O
tumor O
model, O
removal O
of O
only O
the O
C-terminal B-CHEMICAL
propeptide O
from O
full-length O
VEGF-D B-GENE-Y

was O
sufficient O
to O
enhance O
angiogenesis O
and O
tumor O
growth. O
In O
contrast, O
removal O
of O
both O
propeptides O
is O
required O
for O
high O
rates O
of O
lymph O
node O
metastasis. O
The O
findings O
reported O
here O
show O
that O
the O
propeptides O
profoundly O
influence O
molecular O
interactions O
of O
VEGF-D B-GENE-Y
with O
VEGF B-GENE-N
receptors, I-GENE-N
co-receptors, O
and O
heparin, O
and O
its O
effects O
on O
tumor O
biology. O
Switchable O

Elastin-like B-GENE-N
polypeptides I-GENE-N
(ELPs) B-GENE-N
are O
protein O
polymers O
that O
reversibly O

phase O
separate O
in O
response O
to O
increased O
temperature, O

weight. O
If O
it O
were O
possible O
to O
engineer O
their O
phase O

to O
respond O
to O
specific O

substrates, O
ELP B-GENE-N
fusion O
proteins O
might O
be O
engineered O
as O
biosensors, O

agents, O

targeted O
therapies. O
What O
has O
been O
lacking O
is O
a O
strategy O
to O
design O
ELPs B-GENE-N
to O
respond O
to O
specific O
substrates. O
To O
address O
this O
deficiency, O
we O
report O
that O
ELP B-GENE-N
fusion O
proteins O
phase O
separate O
in O
response O
to O
chemical O
inducers O
of O
dimerization O
(CID). O
The O
rationale O
is O
that O
ELP B-GENE-N
phase O
separation O
depends O
on O
molecular O
weight, O

concentration, O
and O
local O
hydrophobicity; O
therefore, O
processes O
that O
affect O
these O
properties, O
including O
noncovalent O
dimerization, O
can O
be O
tuned O
to O
produce O
isothermal O
phase O
separation. O
To O
test O
this O
hypothesis, O
constructs O
were O
evaluated O
consisting O
of O
an O
immunophilin: B-GENE-N

(FKBP) B-GENE-Y
attached O
to O
an O
ELP. B-GENE-N
Under O
stoichiometric O
binding O
of O
a O
CID, O
the O
fusion O
protein O
homodimerizes O
and O
triggers O
phase O
separation. O
This O
dimerization O
is O
reversible O
upon O
saturation O
with O
excess O
CID O
or O
competitive O
binding O
of O
a O
small O
lipophilic O
macrolide O

to O
FKBP. O
By O
modulating O
the O
ELP B-GENE-N
molecular O
weight, O
phase O
separation O
was O
tuned O
for O
isothermal O
response O
to O
CID O
at O
physiological O
ionic O
strength O
and O
temperature O
(37 O
°C). O
To O
interpret O
the O
relationship O
between O
transition O
temperature O
and O
equilibrium O
binding O
constants, O
an O
empirical O
mathematical O
model O
was O
employed. O
To O
the O
best O
of O
our O
knowledge, O
this O
report O
is O
the O
first O
demonstration O
of O
reversible O
ELP B-GENE-N
switching O
in O
response O
to O
controlled O
dimerization. O
Due O
to O
its O
simplicity, O
this O
strategy O
may O
be O
useful O
to O
design O
ELP B-GENE-N
fusion O
proteins O
that O

However, O
repeated O

Consequently, O
the O

The O

establish O
the O
relative O
importance O
of O
AOX B-GENE-N
and O
CYPs B-GENE-N
in O

using O
the O

model. O
The O
procedure O
was O
to O
reduce O
liver O
AOX B-GENE-N

by O

providing O
tungsten B-CHEMICAL

hydralazine B-CHEMICAL
in O
the O
drinking O

to O
use O
the O
AOX-deficient B-GENE-N

None O
of O
these O
approaches O
reduced O
CYP B-GENE-N

Liver O
AOX B-GENE-N

was O
reduced O
by O
45% O
with O
tungsten B-CHEMICAL
and O
61% O
with O
hydralazine B-CHEMICAL
and O
81% O
in O
AOX-deficient B-GENE-N
mice O
relative O
to O
controls. O
When O
mice O
were O
treated O

with O
the O
major O
neonicotinoid O
imidacloprid B-CHEMICAL
(IMI), B-CHEMICAL
metabolism O
by O

was O
not O

affected, O
whereas O
the O
AOX-generated B-GENE-N
nitrosoguanidine B-CHEMICAL
metabolite O
was O
decreased O
by O
30% O
with O
tungsten B-CHEMICAL
and O
56% O
with O
hydralazine B-CHEMICAL
and O
86% O
in O
the O
AOX-deficient B-GENE-N
mice. O
The O
other O
IMI B-CHEMICAL

and O
81% O
with O
tungsten, B-CHEMICAL
hydralazine, B-CHEMICAL
and O
in O
the O
AOX-deficient B-GENE-N
mice, O
respectively. O
Thus, O
decreasing O
liver O
AOX B-GENE-N
activity O
by O
three O
quite O
different O
procedures O
gave O
a O
corresponding O
decrease O
for O

in O
the O
liver O
of O
IMI-treated B-CHEMICAL

no O

RESULTS: O
The O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Acute O

In O
the O

we O
extend O
these O

that O
the O
ability O

when O

When O

Thus, O

Proposed O

Subclinical O

Cushing's O
syndrome O
(SCS) O
associated O
with O
adrenal O
incidentaloma O
is O
usually O
characterized O
by O
autonomous O
cortisol B-CHEMICAL
secretion O
without O
overt O
symptoms O
of O
Cushing's O
syndrome O
(CS). O
Although O
the O
diagnostic O
criteria O
for O
SCS O
differ O
among O
countries, O
the O
1 O
mg O
dexamethasone B-CHEMICAL
suppression O
test O
(DST) O
is O
essential O
to O
confirm O
the O
presence O
and O
the O
extent O
of O
cortisol B-CHEMICAL
overproduction. O
Since O
1995, O
SCS O
has O
been O
diagnosed O
in O
Japan O
based O
on O
serum O
cortisol B-CHEMICAL
levels O
≥3 O
μg/dl O
(measured O
by O
radioimmunoassay O
[RIA]) O
after O

a O
1 O
mg O
DST. O
However, O
the O
increasing O
use O
of O
enzyme O
immunoassays O
(EIA) O
instead O
of O
RIA O
has O
hindered O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
SCS O
because O
of O
the O
differing O
sensitivities O
of O
commercially O
available O
assays, O
particularly O
for O
serum O
cortisol B-CHEMICAL
levels O
of O
around O
3 O
μg/dl. O
One O
way O
to O
overcome O
this O
problem O
is O
to O
lower O
the O
cortisol B-CHEMICAL
threshold O
level O
after O
a O
1 O
mg O

In O
the O

study, O
we O
examined O
the O
clinical O
applicability O

lowering O
the O
cortisol B-CHEMICAL
threshold O
to O
1.8 O
μg/dl, O
similar O
to O
the O
American O
Endocrine O

Society's O
guidelines O
for O
CS, O
by O
reanalyzing O
119 O

Our O
findings O
indicate O
that O
serum O
cortisol B-CHEMICAL
levels O
≥1.8 O
μg/dl O
after O
1 O
mg O
DST O
are O
useful O
to O
confirm O
the O
diagnosis O

if O
both O

and O
(2) O

If O
only O
one O
of O

(1) O
and O
(2) O
are O
met, O
we O
recommend O
that O
other O
clinical O
features O
are O
considered O
in O
the O
diagnosis O

including O

Indeed, O

that O
the O

some O

that O

as O

Because O

once-daily O
dosing O

that O
degludec O
tolerates O

while O
maintaining O
full O

low O

Degludec O
would O
appear O

This O

Because O

Here, O

we O

To O

under O
the O

conditions, O
a O

a O

a O
microfluidic O

which O
can O
mimic O
the O

The O

(HUVEC-C3) O
can O
produce O
a O
FRET-based O

of O
probing O

When O
the O
endothelial O

undergo O
apoptosis, O
the O
color O

changes O
from O

thus O
sensing O

A O

used O
to O

the O

The O

applied O
in O
our O

The O
two O
apoptosis O

techniques O
(fluorescent O

are O
comparable; O
but O
FRET O
biosensor O
offers O
more O
advantages O
such O
as O
real-time O

a O

more O
accurate O

Furthermore, O
the O
activation O
of O
the O
FRET O

also O
confirms O
the O
endothelial O
cell O
apoptosis O
induced O
by O
the O
abnormal O
pulsatile O
shear O

and O
high O

A O
12% O
apoptotic O
rate O
(nearly O
a O
4-fold O

compared O
to O
the O

condition) O
was O
observed O
when O
the O

Therefore, O
the O
most O

finding O

this O

to O

which O

This O
finding O
may O

However, O

Expression O

Both O
rooibos O

Compared O

which O
is O

Furthermore, O
the O

show O

that O

in O
human O

Puerarin B-CHEMICAL
promotes O
proliferation O
by O
altering O
cell O

whereas O
puerarin-mediated B-CHEMICAL

may O
be O
associated O

the O

of O
puerarin B-CHEMICAL
on O

Using O
small O

technology, O
we O
further O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
effects O
of O
puerarin B-CHEMICAL

on O
proliferation, O

and O
survival O
are O
mediated O
by O
both O
ERα B-GENE-Y
and O

Moreover, O
we O
also O
demonstrate O
that O
puerarin B-CHEMICAL
functions O
at O
least O
partially O
through O
activation O
of O
MEK/ERK B-GENE-N
and O
PI3K/Akt B-GENE-N

This O
agent O
also O
shows O
much O
weaker O

Therefore, O
puerarin B-CHEMICAL
will O
be O
a O
promising O

that O
prevents O

We O

that O

We O

the O

This O

The O

The O

view O
this O

an O

general O
phenomena O

Triclosan B-CHEMICAL

(2,4,4',-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenylether) B-CHEMICAL
is O
a O
well-known O
and O
widely O
used O
nonionic O
antibacterial O
agent O
which O
has O
recently O
been O
introduced O
in O
toothpastes O
and O
mouthrinses. O
The O
efficacy O
of O
triclosan-containing B-CHEMICAL

mouthrinse O
to O
reduce O
both O
plaque O
and O
gingivitis O
in O
long-term O
clinical O
trials O
has O
been O
well O
documented. O
Until O
recently, O
it O
was O
generally O
assumed O
that O
triclosan's O
effect O
on O
gingival O
inflammation O
was O
due O
to O
its O
antimicrobial O
and O
anti-plaque O
effect. O

It O
has O
now O
become O
apparent O
that O
triclosan B-CHEMICAL
may O
have O
a O
direct O
anti-inflammatory O
effect O
on O
the O
gingival O
tissues. O
Several O
in O

studies O
were O
conducted O
to O
evaluate O
the O
effect O
of O
triclosan B-CHEMICAL
on O
4 O
primary O
enzymes O
of O
the O
pathways O

cyclo-oxygenase B-GENE-Y
2, I-GENE-Y
5-lipoxygenase B-GENE-Y
and O
15-lipoxygenase. B-GENE-Y
These O
pathways O
lead O
to O
the O
production O
of O
known O
mediators O
of O
inflammation O
such O
as O
the O
prostaglandins, B-CHEMICAL
leukotrienes B-CHEMICAL
and O
lipoxins. B-CHEMICAL

Triclosan B-CHEMICAL
inhibited O
both O
cyclooxygenase B-GENE-Y
1 I-GENE-Y
and O
cyclo-oxygenase B-GENE-Y
2 I-GENE-Y
with O
IC-50 O
values O
of O
43 O
microM O
and O
227 O

respectively. O
Triclosan B-CHEMICAL
also O
inhibited O
5-lipoxygenase B-GENE-Y
with O
an O
IC-50 O
of O
43 O
microM. O
The O
15-lipoxygenase B-GENE-Y
was O
similarly O
inhibited O
by O
triclosan B-CHEMICAL
with O
an O
IC-50 O
of O
61 O
microM. O
Hence, O
triclosan B-CHEMICAL
has O
the O
ability O
to O
inhibit O
both O
the O
cyclo-oxygenase B-GENE-N
and O
lipoxygenase B-GENE-N
pathways O

of O
arachidonic B-CHEMICAL
acid I-CHEMICAL
metabolism O
with O
similar O
efficacy. O
In O
cell O

it O
was O
found O
that O
triclosan B-CHEMICAL
inhibited O
IL-1 B-GENE-Y

These O

that O

The O

Adapalene, B-CHEMICAL
a O

Adapalene B-CHEMICAL
is O
a O
novel O
chemical O
entity O
which, O
in O
terms O
of O
pharmacology, O
behaves O
similar O
to O
tretinoin, B-CHEMICAL
but O
is O
chemically O
and O
photochemically O
stable. O
It O
has O
a O
particular O

for O
the O
known O
nuclear O

for O

alpha I-GENE-Y
and O
no O

transactivating O

This O
receptor O
profile O
could O
imply O
that O
adapalene, B-CHEMICAL
in O
contrast O
to O
tretinoin, B-CHEMICAL
affects O
the O
terminal O
differentiation O
pathway O
of O
epidermal O
cells O
rather O

Furthermore, O
adapalene B-CHEMICAL
does O
not O
bind O
to O
members O
of O
the O
cellular O
retinoic B-CHEMICAL

Adapalene B-CHEMICAL

It O
exerts O
a O
moderate-to-potent O

In O
comparative O

the O

The O

that O

be O

In O
these O

Oral O

In O

Finally, O
the O
three O
drugs O
were O
compared O
with O
the O
angiotensin B-GENE-Y

The O

were O
also O
measured. O
Our O
results O
show O
that O
remikiren B-CHEMICAL

as O

CGP B-CHEMICAL

Interestingly, O
these O

potency O

different O
biochemical O
changes O
of O
the O
plasma O

because O
the O
inhibitors O
all O
reduced O
immunoreactive O

One O
possible O

is O
that, O
in O
our O
model, O

remikiren B-CHEMICAL
in O

CGP B-CHEMICAL

(PGHS-1) B-GENE-Y
and O
of O
the O

form O
(PGHS-2). B-GENE-Y
By O
immunohistochemical O
staining, O
we O
found O
that O
PGHS-1 B-GENE-Y
is O
the O
main O
isoform O
present O
in O
the O
dermal O
papilla O
from O
normal O
human O
hair O
follicle O
(either O
anagen O
or O

whereas O
PGHS-2 B-GENE-Y
was O
only O
faintly O
and O
exclusively O
expressed O
in O
anagen O
dermal O
papilla. O
Thus, O
PGHS-1 B-GENE-Y
might O
be O
the O
primary O
target O
of O
the O
hair O
growth-inhibitory O
effects O
of O
NSAIDs. O
We O
thus O

speculated O
that O
activation O
of O
PGHS-1 B-GENE-Y
might O
be O
a O
mechanism O
by O
which O
minoxidil B-CHEMICAL
(2,4-diamino-6-piperidinopyrimidine-3-oxyde) B-CHEMICAL
stimulates O
hair O
growth O
in O

We O
demonstrate O
here O
that O
minoxidil B-CHEMICAL
is O
a O
potent O
activator O
of O
purified O
PGHS-1 B-GENE-Y
(AC50 O
= O
80 O
microM), O
as O
assayed O
by O

This O
activation O
was O
also O
evidenced O
by O

by O
BALB/c O

and O
by O

Our O
findings O
suggest O
that O
minoxidil B-CHEMICAL
and O
its O
derivatives O
may O
have O
a O
cytoprotective O
activity O
in O

and O
that O
more O
potent O

might O
be O
designed, O

on O
this O

Incidentally, O
this O

cause O

To O
complete O
the O
analogy O

it O
is O
curious O
that O
despite O

neither O

Complete O

however, O
so O
what O

we O
likely O

Might O

come O
right O
in O

with O

minor O

Experience O
with O

suggests O
that O
such O
a O

but O
not O
in O

of O

(O'Rahilly O

Androgen B-GENE-Y

mutations O
are O
found O
in O
nearly O
all O
cases O
of O
complete O
androgen O

rarely O
in O
partial O

(Patterson O

Mild O

is O
rarely O
detectable O
in O
relatives O

are O
heterozygous O

It O
seems O

therefore, O
that O
individuals O

manifest O
