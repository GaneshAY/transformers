It O

Endogenous O

The O

include O

determined O
using O

The O

The O

The O

Thus, O
opioids O

In O

Ornithine B-GENE-Y

catalyses O
the O

The O

at O

they O
may O

Therefore, O

Using O

BACKGROUND: O
Quetiapine B-CHEMICAL

a O
new O

medication. O
As O
such, O
relatively O
little O

these O

clinical O

and O

METHODS: O

Two O

the O

the O
drug O
2 O

3 O
hours O

RESULTS: O
Quetiapine B-CHEMICAL
was O
an O
effective O
antipsychotic O
and O
improved O
the O
extrapyramidal O

It O
achieved O
these O
results O
with O
minimal O
(0%-27%) O
D2 B-GENE-Y
occupancy O
12 O
hours O
after O
the O
last O
dose. O
Study O
of O
the O
additional O
subjects O
revealed O
that O
quetiapine B-CHEMICAL
does O
give O
rise O
to O
transiently O
high O
(58%-64%) O
D2 B-GENE-Y
occupancy O
2 O
to O
3 O
hours O
after O
a O
single O
dose O
that O
then O
decreases O

minimal O
levels O
in O
12 O
hours. O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Quetiapine B-CHEMICAL
shows O
a O
transiently O
high O
D2 B-GENE-Y
occupancy, O
which O
decreases O
to O
very O
low O
levels O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dosing O
interval. O
Quetiapine's O
low O
D2 B-GENE-Y
occupancy O
can O
explain O
its O
freedom O
from O
extrapyramidal O
symptoms O
and O
prolactin O
level O
elevation. O
The O
data O
suggest O
that O
transient O
D2 B-GENE-Y
occupancy O
may O
be O
sufficient O
for O
its O
antipsychotic O
effect. O
Future O
studies O
controlling O

nonpharmacological O

PURPOSE: O
To O
determine O
whether O
the O
volatile O
anesthetic O
halothane B-CHEMICAL
protects O
against O
light-induced O
photoreceptor B-GENE-N
degeneration O
in O
the O

METHODS: O
Albino O
mice O
and O
rats O
were O
anesthetized O
with O
halothane B-CHEMICAL
and O
exposed O
to O
high O
levels O
of O
white O
or O
blue O
light. O
Nonanesthetized O
animals O
served O
as O
controls. O
Retinal O

was O
assessed O
by O
light O
microscopy, O
and O
apoptosis O
of O
photoreceptor B-GENE-N
cells O

was O
verified O
by O
detection O
of O
fragmented O
genomic O
DNA O
and O
in O

staining O
of O
apoptotic O
nuclei O
(TUNEL O
assay). O
Rhodopsin B-GENE-N
regeneration O
after O
bleaching O
was O
determined O
by O
measuring O
rhodopsin B-GENE-N
levels O
in O
retinas O
of O
mice O
or O
rats O
at O
different O
time O
points O
in O
darkness. O
RESULTS: O
Halothane B-CHEMICAL
anesthesia O
reversibly O
inhibited O
metabolic O
rhodopsin B-GENE-N
regeneration O
and O
thus O
prevented O
rhodopsin B-GENE-N
from O
absorbing O
high O
numbers O
of O
photons O
during O
light O
exposure. O
Consequently, O
photoreceptors B-GENE-N
of O
mice O
and O
rats O
anesthetized O
with O

halothane B-CHEMICAL
were O
completely O
protected O
against O
degeneration O
induced O
by O
white O
light. O
In O
remarkable O
contrast, O
however, O
halothane B-CHEMICAL
anesthesia O
did O
not O
protect O
against O
blue-light-induced O
photoreceptor O
cell O
death. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
After O
the O
initial O
bleach, O
halothane B-CHEMICAL
impeded O
photon O
absorption O
by O
rhodopsin B-GENE-N
by O
inhibiting O
metabolic O
rhodopsin B-GENE-N
regeneration. O
Apparently, O
the O
rhodopsin-mediated B-GENE-N
uptake O
of O
the O
critical O
number O
of O
photons O
to O
initiate O
white O
light-induced O
retinal O
degeneration O
was O
prevented. O
In O
contrast, O
halothane B-CHEMICAL
did O
not O
protect O

the O
retina O
against O
blue O
light. O
Blue O
light O
can O
efficiently O
restore O
functional O
rhodopsin B-GENE-N
from O
bleaching O
intermediates O
through O
a O
process O
termed O
photoreversal O
of O
bleaching. O
This O
process O
does O
not O
depend O
on O
the O
visual O
cycle O
via O
the O
pigment O
epithelium O
but O
nevertheless O
enables O
rhodopsin B-GENE-N
molecules O
to O
absorb O
the O
critical O
number O
of O
photons O
required O
to O
induce O
retinal O
degeneration. O

RESULTS: O
All O
antidepressants O
were O

in O
4-week-old O

with O
the O
exception O
of O
fluvoxamine B-CHEMICAL
in O
the O

The O
anti-immobility O

administration O
was O
higher O
in O
4-week-old O
male O

male O
mice. O
Venlafaxine B-CHEMICAL
is O
the O
most O
active O
antidepressant O
drug O
in O

40-week-old O
mice. O
Prior O
administration O
of O
buspirone B-CHEMICAL
(0.06 O
mg/kg, O
i.p.) O
or O
anpirtoline B-CHEMICAL
(1 O
mg/kg, O

enhanced O
the O

effects O
in O
4-week-old O
mice O
(except O
in O
the O
case O
of O
sertraline, B-CHEMICAL
8 O
mg/kg). O
In O
elderly O
mice, O
only O
prior O
administration O
of O
buspirone B-CHEMICAL
enhanced O
the O
antidepressant-like O
effects O
of O
fluvoxamine. B-CHEMICAL
A O
neurochemical O
study O
showed O
that O
significantly O
higher O
serotonin B-CHEMICAL
and O
dopamine B-CHEMICAL
concentrations O
were O
found O
in O

40-week-old O
control O
mice O

4-week-old O
control O
mice O
brains O
but O
that O
the O
noradrenaline B-CHEMICAL

in O
4-week-old O
mice. O
CONCLUSION: O
Tricyclic, B-CHEMICAL
noradrenaline B-CHEMICAL
reuptake O
inhibitors O
and O
serotonin B-CHEMICAL
reuptake O
inhibitors O
are O
more O
active O
in O

In O
this O

we O
isolated O
cDNAs O
coding O

three O

The O

by O

DHFS B-GENE-Y
is O

making O
this O
compartment O
the O
sole O
site O
of O
synthesis O

dihydrofolate B-CHEMICAL
in O
the O

In O
contrast, O
FPGS B-GENE-N

as O
distinct O

the O
mitochondria, O
the O

Each O

The O
compartmentation O

Thus, O
the O
combination O
of O
FPGS B-GENE-N

Also, O
the O

BACKGROUND: O
Neuronal B-GENE-N
nicotinic I-GENE-N
acetylcholine I-GENE-N

almost O
exclusively O
on O
presynaptic O

in O
the O
central O

and O

stimulate O
neurotransmitter O

This O
study O
tested O
whether O
nAChR B-GENE-N

stimulate O
spinal O

of O
the O
neurotransmitter O
norepinephrine B-CHEMICAL
either O
by O
direct O

or O
indirectly O

METHODS: O
Adult O

were O
anesthetized O
and O
microdialysis O
probes O
inserted O
in O
the O
L2-L4 O

Probes O

To O

synaptosomes O
were O
prepared O
from O

RESULTS: O
Both O

Both O

the O

CONCLUSION: O
These O

that O
one O

Retigabine B-CHEMICAL
undergoes O
phase O
II O
metabolism O
(N-glucuronidation, B-CHEMICAL

exclusively O
and O

OBJECTIVE: O
Our O
objective O
was O
to O
evaluate O

the O
effects O

of O
retigabine. B-CHEMICAL
METHODS: O
Healthy O

(12 O

received O
a O
single O
200-mg O

of O
retigabine. B-CHEMICAL
After O
dosing, O
blood O
was O
collected O
over O
a O
72-hour O

to O
determine O
plasma O

of O
retigabine B-CHEMICAL

metabolite, O
AWD21-360. B-CHEMICAL
Pharmacokinetics O
was O

ANOVA. O
RESULTS: O
In O
young O
men, O
retigabine B-CHEMICAL
was O
rapidly O
absorbed, O
with O
the O
maximum O
concentration O
occurring O
within O
2 O
hours, O
and O
was O
eliminated O
with O
an O

Subjects O
were O
similarly O
exposed O
to O
AWD21-360. B-CHEMICAL
Compared O
with O
young O
men, O
young O
women O
had O
higher O
retigabine B-CHEMICAL
maximum O
concentration O
(56%) O
and O
exposure O
(20%) O
but O
similar O
clearance O
(0.68 O
L O
x O
h(-1) O
x O

kg(-1)); O
these O
differences O
were O
related O
to O
differences O
in O
body O
weight. O
Although O
maximum O
concentration O
was O
similar O
in O
elderly O
subjects, O
retigabine B-CHEMICAL
elimination O
was O
slower O
(30% O
lower O
apparent O
clearance O
normalized O
for O
weight), O
resulting O
in O
higher O
exposure O
(42%) O
and O
a O
longer O
half-life O
(30%). O
Because O
phase O
II O
metabolism O
is O
scarcely O
affected O
by O
age, O
these O
differences O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
known O
decline O
of O
renal O

with O
age. O
CONCLUSIONS: O
Although O
there O
are O
no O
substantial O
sex-related O
differences O
in O

The O

that O

account O

OBJECTIVE: O
Because O

In O

was O
down-regulated O

In O
contrast, O
hRRM2 B-GENE-Y

up-regulated O
by O

both O

hRRM2 B-GENE-Y

the O

Coimmunoprecipitation O

confirmed O
that O

decreased O

but O
increased O
in O

after O

hRRM2 B-GENE-Y
binding O
to O
hRRM1 B-GENE-N
increased O
in O
both O
cell O
lines O
under O
the O

conditions. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
PC3 O

are O
deficient O
in O
both O
transcription O

Confocal O

further O
confirmed O
that O
these O

were O
not O
due O
to O
translocation O
of O

hRRM2 B-GENE-Y
and O
p53R2 B-GENE-Y
from O
the O

RR B-GENE-N

measured O

shown O

It O
was O

The O
RR B-GENE-N

is O
consistent O
with O
the O
expression O
of O
hRRM2 B-GENE-N
seen O
in O
the O

Thus, O
we O
hypothesize O
that O
hRRM2 B-GENE-Y
complements O

to O
form O
RR B-GENE-N
holoenzyme O
and O
maintain O
RR B-GENE-N
activity O
in O
PC3 O

after O

treatment. O
To O
further O
confirm O
this O
hypothesis, O
we O
examined O
the O
effect O
of O

RRM2 B-GENE-Y
inhibitors O
on O
cells O
exposed O
to O
UV. O
In O
PC3 O
cells, O
hydroxyurea B-CHEMICAL
inhibited O
hRRM2 B-GENE-Y
and O
resulted O
in O
increased O

We O
also O
examined O
the O

UV O
treatment O
on O
the O

with O
hRRM2 B-GENE-Y
as O
well O
as O

sense O

Expression O
of O
antisense O
hRRM2 B-GENE-Y

led O
to O
decreased O

resulted O
in O
greater O
sensitivity O

Taken O
together, O
we O

conclude O
that O

Furthermore, O

Finally, O
we O

Likewise, O

In O
the O

Various O

the O

The O

Thalidomide B-CHEMICAL

Both O

Thalidomide B-CHEMICAL
decreased O
the O

COX-2 B-GENE-Y
is O
a O

Although O

Because O
thalidomide B-CHEMICAL

a O
therapeutic O
strategy O

Nicotinic B-CHEMICAL

long O
been O
used O

as O

unique O
among O

Recently, O
a O

termed O
GPR109A B-GENE-Y
(HM74A B-GENE-Y
in O
humans, O

was O
described O
and O
shown O
to O
mediate O
the O
nicotinic B-CHEMICAL

in O
adipocytes. O
One O
of O
the O
major O
problems O
of O
the O
pharmacotherapeutical O

use O
of O
nicotinic B-CHEMICAL
acid I-CHEMICAL
is O
a O

This O
side O

strongly O
affects O

In O
the O

study, O
we O
show O
that O
mice O
lacking O
PUMA-G B-GENE-Y
did O
not O
show O
nicotinic B-CHEMICAL
acid-induced I-CHEMICAL

In O
addition, O

also O
abrogated O
in O

This O

some O
findings O
of O
a O
research O
that O
I O
have O
pursued O
for O
the O
past O
25 O
years, O
whose O

of O
the O
vitamin O

biotin, B-CHEMICAL
starting O
with O
a O
patient O
with O
multiple O

deficiency O
(MCD). O
Several O
of O
MCD O
clinical O
manifestations O
resemble O
those O
of O
infant O
malnutrition; O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
about O
one-third O
of O
infants O
with O
this O
common O
nutritional O
disorder O
were O
indeed O
biotin-deficient, B-CHEMICAL
and O
that O
this O
deficiency O
is O
metabolically O
significant, O
by O
studying O
urine O
instead O
of O
blood, O
studying O
urinary O
organic O

by O
gas O

Remarkably, O
the O
metabolic O
abnormalities O
became O
apparent O
only O
after O
protein O
feeding O
was O
started, O
suggesting O
that O
this O
phenomenon O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
worsening O
of O
malnourished O
individuals O
when O
they O

are O
abruptly O
fed. O
Afterwards, O
we O
studied O
biotin B-CHEMICAL

at O
the O

Carboxylase B-GENE-N

were O
significantly O
reduced O
in O
liver, O
kidney, O

adipose O
tissue, O

and O
spleen, O
but O
brain O

were O
spared; O
their O

unchanged. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
holocarboxylase B-GENE-Y

mRNA O
levels O
were O
markedly O
low O
in O
the O

increased O
upon O

Over O
2000 O
human O
genes O
have O
been O
identified O
that O
depend O
on O
biotin B-CHEMICAL

To O

we O
have O
started O
comparative O

among O
evolutionarily O

we O

the O

In O
the O

we O
used O

the O

because O

How O

Fluorouracil B-CHEMICAL

Both O

The O
reasons O
why O

routinely O
are O
difficulties O
in O
defining, O
predicting O

and O
achieving O
an O
optimal O
fluorouracil B-CHEMICAL

dose O
because O
of O
a O

assessment O

the O

dihydropyrimidine B-GENE-Y

be O
useful, O
because O
this O

and O
3-5% O

of O
Caucasians, O
respectively, O
leads O
to O
increased O
fluorouracil B-CHEMICAL
exposure O
and O
toxicity. O
Several O
methods O
to O
assess O
DPD B-GENE-Y
activity O
in O
patients O
have O
been O
proposed O
(genotyping, O
various O
phenotyping O
methods), O
but O
each O
of O
them O
has O
limitations, O
as O
has O
the O
fluorouracil B-CHEMICAL

approach. O
To O
adapt O
exposure O
towards O
fluorouracil B-CHEMICAL
a O

a O
combination O
of O
genotyping O
and O
phenotyping O
may O
yield O
better O
prediction O
of O
toxicity O
than O
one O
method O
alone. O
A O
prerequisite O
for O
dose O

is O
the O
definition O
of O
fluorouracil B-CHEMICAL
exposure O
ranges O
with O
sufficient O
therapeutic O

without O

We O

TRbeta B-GENE-Y

In O

In O

we O
observed O

the O

is O
largely O

The O

that O
we O
observed O
a O

which O
are O

suggests O
that O

Our O

that, O
in O

To O

we O

BACKGROUND: O
Acute O
administration O
of O
different O
classes O
of O
antidepressants O
can O
enhance O
or O
reduce O
spontaneous O
locomotor O

in O
a O

the O

chronic O
antidepressant O
treatment O
on O
spontaneous O
locomotor O
activity O
in O
novel O
and O

familiar O
environments O
are O
less O
well O
characterized. O
Because O
norepinephrine B-CHEMICAL
is O
an O
important O
regulator O
of O
spontaneous O
locomotor O
activity, O
we O
speculated O
that O
norepinephrine B-GENE-Y
transporter I-GENE-Y
blockade O
contributes O
to O
the O
effects O
of O
some O
antidepressants O
on O
spontaneous O

METHODS: O
Antidepressant O
drugs O
(reboxetine, B-CHEMICAL

norepinephrine B-GENE-Y

knockout O
mice, O

spontaneous O

environments O
was O
recorded. O
RESULTS: O
Acute O
treatment O
with O
most O
norepinephrine B-GENE-Y
transporter-blocking I-GENE-Y
antidepressants O
decreased O
spontaneous O
locomotor O
activity O
in O
a O
novel O
environment, O
whereas O
chronic O
treatment O
decreased O
spontaneous O
locomotor O
activity O
in O
both O
novel O
and O
familiar O
environments. O
The O
exception O
was O
bupropion, B-CHEMICAL
a O
dual O
norepinephrine B-CHEMICAL
transporter/dopamine I-GENE-Y
transporter I-GENE-Y
blocker, O
which O
tended O
to O
increase O

reboxetine B-CHEMICAL
and O
the O
dopamine B-CHEMICAL

CONCLUSIONS: O
Acute O
or O
chronic O
inactivation O
of O
the O
norepinephrine B-GENE-Y

In O

A O

Unfortunately, O

OBJECTIVE: O
Telmisartan, B-CHEMICAL
an O
angiotensin B-GENE-Y
II I-GENE-Y
type I-GENE-Y
1 I-GENE-Y
receptor I-GENE-Y
(AT1R) B-GENE-Y
antagonist, O

a O
partial O
agonist O
of O
peroxisome B-GENE-Y

(PPARgamma). B-GENE-Y
Since O
previous O
studies O
have O
demonstrated O
that O
PPARgamma B-GENE-Y
activators O
suppressed O
AT1R B-GENE-Y
expression, O
we O
examined O
whether O
telmisartan B-CHEMICAL
affects O
AT1R B-GENE-Y
expression O
in O
vascular O

cells. O
METHODS: O
Vascular O
smooth O

were O
derived O
from O
the O
thoracic O

of O
Wistar-Kyoto O
rat. O
Northern O
and O
Western O

were O
used O
to O
examine O
AT1R B-GENE-Y
mRNA O
and O

respectively. O
The O
DEAE-dextran O
method O
was O
used O
for O
transfection, O
and O
the O
promoter O
activity O
of O
AT1R B-GENE-Y
was O
examined O
by O

luciferase O
assay. O
RESULTS: O
Telmisartan B-CHEMICAL
decreased O
the O
expression O
of O
AT1R B-GENE-Y
at O
the O
mRNA O
and O
protein O
levels O
in O
a O
dose- O
and O
time-dependent O
manner. O
Decreased O
AT1R B-GENE-N
promoter I-GENE-N
activity O
with O
unchanged O
mRNA O
stability O
suggested O
that O
telmisartan B-CHEMICAL
suppressed O
AT1R B-GENE-Y
gene O
expression O
at O
the O
transcriptional O
level. O
However, O
the O
expression O
of O
AT1R B-GENE-Y
was O
not O
suppressed O
by O
other O
AT1R B-GENE-Y
antagonists O
such O
as O
candesartan B-CHEMICAL
or O
olmesartan. B-CHEMICAL
Since O
the O

was O
prevented O
by O
pretreatment O
with O
GW9662, B-CHEMICAL

a O
PPARgamma B-GENE-Y
antagonist, O
PPARgamma B-GENE-Y

participated O
in O
the O
process. O
The O
deletion O

analysis O
of O
the O

indicated O
that O
a O

CONCLUSION: O
Our O

but O
the O
molecular O
mechanism O
and O

remain O
poorly O

Upon O
differentiation, O
osteoclasts O
express O
vesicular B-GENE-Y

which O
is O
essential O
for O

exocytosis O

of O

VGLUT1 B-GENE-Y
is O
localized O
in O

Osteoclasts O
secrete O

Osteoclasts O

Its O
stimulation O
by O
a O

inhibits O
secretion O

whereas O
its O

resorption. O
Finally, O
it O
was O

Thus, O
in O
bone-resorbing O
osteoclasts, O
L-glutamate B-CHEMICAL

Correlative O
laboratory O
studies O
of O
clinical O
trials O
have O
shown O
that O
decitabine B-CHEMICAL
induces O
global O
hypomethylation O
as O
well O
as O
hypomethylation O
of O
gene-specific O
promoters O
and O

expression. O
Past O
a O

induction O
of O
higher O
degrees O
of O

hypomethylation O
is O
not O
directly O
associated O
with O
a O
better O
clinical O
outcome. O
Moreover, O
studies O
have O
suggested O
that O
patients O
with O
promoter O
hypermethylation O
of O

at O
baseline O
have O
paradoxically O
a O
lower O
chance O
of O
achieving O

than O
those O
without O
hypermethylation. O
Furthermore, O
several O
other O
genes O
activated O
by O
decitabine B-CHEMICAL
were O
independent O
of O
hypomethylation O
in O
the O

regions. O
CONCLUSION: O
While O
at O
least O
part O
of O
decitabine's O
activity O
is O
through O
induction O
of O
hypomethylation O
and O
reactivation O

mechanisms O
independent O
from O

are O
also O

Purpose O
of O
our O

it. O
To O
characterize O
an O
ER-dependent B-GENE-Y
mechanism, O
ERalpha/beta B-GENE-N
expression O
was O
evaluated. O
Cd B-CHEMICAL
decreased O
ERalpha B-GENE-Y
expression, O
but O
not O

Cd B-CHEMICAL
also O
increased O
ERK1/2, B-GENE-N
Akt B-GENE-N
and O
PDGFRalpha B-GENE-Y
phosphorylation O
while O
ICI O
blocked O
it. O
Since O
stimulation O
of O

was O
slower O
than O
expected, O
c-fos B-GENE-Y
and O
c-jun B-GENE-Y
proto-oncogenes, O
and O
PDGFA B-GENE-Y
were O
analyzed. O
Cd B-CHEMICAL
rapidly O
increased O
c-jun, B-GENE-N
c-fos B-GENE-N
and O
PDGFA B-GENE-Y
expression. O
Cells O
were O
also O

co-incubated O
with O
the O
Cd B-CHEMICAL
and O
specific O

inhibitors, O
which O
blocked O
the O
Cd-stimulated B-CHEMICAL

In O
conclusion, O
our O
results O
indicate O
that O
Cd B-CHEMICAL
increases O

Vav1 B-GENE-Y

However, O
it O

how O

In O
an O
effort O
to O
explore O

we O
found O
that O
calmodulin B-GENE-Y

a O
calcium-dependent B-CHEMICAL

The O

a O

role O
of O
Vav1 B-GENE-N

The O

that O
Vav1 B-GENE-Y

cooperatively O

This O

mechanism O
by O
which O
the O
Vav1 B-GENE-N
CH I-GENE-N

is O
involved O

and O
provides O
insight O
into O
our O
understanding O

The O
transporters O
GlyT2 B-GENE-Y
and O
VIAAT B-GENE-Y
cooperate O
to O

The O
mechanisms O
that O
specify O
the O
vesicular O
phenotype O
of O
inhibitory O
interneurons O
in O
vertebrates O
are O
poorly O
understood O
because O
the O
two O
main O
inhibitory O
transmitters, O
glycine B-CHEMICAL

GABA, B-CHEMICAL
share O
the O
same O
vesicular B-GENE-Y
inhibitory I-GENE-Y
amino B-CHEMICAL
acid I-CHEMICAL
transporter I-GENE-Y
(VIAAT) B-GENE-Y
and O
are O
both O
present O
in O

during O

We O
have O
expressed O
VIAAT B-GENE-Y
and O
the O
plasmalemmal B-GENE-N
transporters I-GENE-N
for O
glycine B-CHEMICAL

GABA B-CHEMICAL
in O
a O
neuroendocrine O

and O
measured O
the O
quantal O
release O
of O
glycine B-CHEMICAL

GABA B-CHEMICAL
using O
a O
novel O

double-sniffer O
patch-clamp O
technique. O
We O
found O
that O
glycine B-CHEMICAL
is O
released O
from O
vesicles O
when O
VIAAT B-GENE-Y
is O
coexpressed O
with O
either O
the O
neuronal B-GENE-N
transporter I-GENE-N
GlyT2 B-GENE-Y
or O
the O
glial B-GENE-N
transporter I-GENE-N
GlyT1. B-GENE-Y
However, O
GlyT2 B-GENE-Y
was O
more O
effective O
than O
GlyT1, B-GENE-Y
probably O
because O
GlyT2 B-GENE-Y
is O
unable O
to O
operate O
in O
the O
reverse O
mode, O
which O
gives O
it O
an O
advantage O
in O
maintaining O
the O
high O
cytosolic O
glycine B-CHEMICAL
concentration O
required O
for O
efficient O
vesicular O
loading O
by O
VIAAT. B-GENE-Y
The O
vesicular O
inhibitory O
phenotype O
was O
gradually O
altered O
from O

glycinergic O
to O
GABAergic O
through O
mixed O
events O
when O
GABA B-CHEMICAL
is O
introduced O
into O
the O
secretory O
cell O
and O
competes O
for O
uptake O
by O
VIAAT. B-GENE-Y
Interestingly, O
the O
VIAAT B-GENE-N
ortholog O
from O
Caenorhabditis O
elegans O
(UNC-47), O
a O
species O
lacking O
glycine B-CHEMICAL
transmission, O
also O
supports O
glycine B-CHEMICAL
exocytosis O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
GlyT2, B-GENE-N
and O
a O
point O
mutation O
of O
UNC-47 O
that O
abolishes O
GABA B-CHEMICAL
transmission O
in O
the O
worm O
confers O
glycine O
specificity. O
Together, O
these O
results O
suggest O
that O
an O
increased O
cytosolic O
availability O

of O
glycine B-CHEMICAL

Phenserine B-CHEMICAL
deserves O
attention O
for O
an O
additional O
quality O
of O
action: O
in O
addition O
to O
inhibiting O
AChE, B-GENE-Y
it O
modulates O
the O
amount O
of O
beta-amyloid B-GENE-Y
precursor I-GENE-Y
protein I-GENE-Y
(APP) B-GENE-Y
in O
neuronal O
cell O
culture O
by O
reducing O
APP B-GENE-Y
translation. O
This O
effect O
probably O
involves O
interaction O
of O
phenserine B-CHEMICAL
with O
a O
regulatory O
element O
in O
the O
5'-untranslated O
region O
of O
the O
APP B-GENE-Y
gene O
that O
controls O
APP B-GENE-Y
expression. O
Phenserine B-CHEMICAL
apparently O
reduces O
translational O
efficiency O

protein, O
a O
process O
that O
may O

an O

As O
a O
consequence, O
phenserine B-CHEMICAL
reduces O

Phenserine B-CHEMICAL
is O
also O
unique O
because O

its O
enantiomers: O
(-)-phenserine B-CHEMICAL
is O
the O

as O
an O

Both O

This O

We O
hypothesized O

be O
significantly O

the O

To O

this O
hypothesis, O

The O

The O

that O

the O

found O
to O
be O
selective, O

whereas O

The O

The O
importance O

Taken O

that O

B2-O-CH(2)CH(2)-N-diethyl) B-CHEMICAL
is O
an O
effective O

III O
antiarrhythmic O
drug O
demonstrating O
potentially O

life-threatening O
organ O
toxicity. O
The O
principal O
aim O
of O
the O
study O
was O
to O
find O
amiodarone B-CHEMICAL

that O
retained O

EXPERIMENTAL O
APPROACH: O
We O
synthesized O
amiodarone B-CHEMICAL
analogues O
with O
or O
without O
a O
positively O
ionizable O
nitrogen B-CHEMICAL
in O
the O
phenolic B-CHEMICAL

The O
cytotoxic O

were O
evaluated O
using O
HepG2 O
(a O

and O
A549 O

(a O

pneumocyte O

Interactions O
of O
all O

were O
measured O
using O
pharmacological O
and O
in O

methods. O
KEY O
RESULTS: O
Compared O
with O
amiodarone, B-CHEMICAL
which O

only O
a O
weak O

(B2-O-CH(2)-COOH) B-CHEMICAL
and, O
finally, O
the O
newly O
synthesized O

B2-O-CH(2)-CH(2)-N-pyrrolidine B-CHEMICAL
were O
equally O
or O
more O
toxic. O
Conversely, O
structural O

such O
as O
the O
B2-O-CH(2)-CH(2)-N-diisopropyl B-CHEMICAL
and O
the O
B2-O-CH(2)-CH(2)-N-piperidine B-CHEMICAL
were O
significantly O
less O

than O
amiodarone. B-CHEMICAL
Cytotoxicity O
was O
associated O
with O
a O

Pharmacological O
and O
in O
silico O
investigations O
concerning O
the O
interactions O
of O
these O
compounds O
with O

the O
hERG B-GENE-Y
channel O
revealed O
that O
compounds O
carrying O
a O
basic O
nitrogen B-CHEMICAL
in O
the O
side O
chain O
display O
a O
much O
higher O
affinity O
than O
those O
lacking O
such O
a O
group. O
Specifically, O
B2-O-CH(2)-CH(2)-N-piperidine B-CHEMICAL
and O
B2-O-CH(2)-CH(2)-N-pyrrolidine B-CHEMICAL
revealed O
a O
higher O
affinity O
towards O
hERG B-GENE-Y
channels O
than O
amiodarone. B-CHEMICAL
CONCLUSIONS O

profile O
of O
etomidate. B-CHEMICAL

Etomidate B-CHEMICAL
has O
been O
used O
since O
1972 O
as O
an O
inductor O
and O
in O
maintaining O
anesthesia. O
There O
are O
multiple O
mechanisms O
that O
account O
for O
the O
biologic O
effects O
of O
etomidate. B-CHEMICAL
One O
of O
the O
most O
prominent O
features O
of O
this O
drug O
is O
that O
it O
provides O
anesthesia O
without O
gross O
changes O
in O
hemodynamic O
parameters. O
This O
feature O
allows O
using O
etomidate B-CHEMICAL
in O
patients O
with O
considerable O
cardiopulmonary O
compromise O
avoiding O
the O
characteristic O
hypotension O
produced O
by O
other O
anesthetics. O
The O
mechanism O
that O
provides O
the O
basis O
for O
its O
cardiovascular O
stability O
is O
the O
capacity O
to O
bind O
and O
stimulate O
peripheral O
alpha-2B B-GENE-Y
adrenergic I-GENE-Y
receptors I-GENE-Y
with O

a O
subsequent O
vasoconstriction. O
Alterations O
in O
the O
function O
or O
number O
of O
these O
receptors O
may O
account O
for O
abnormal O
responses O
during O

organic O
acidemias O
such O
as O
propionic, O
methylmalonic, O
and O
isovaleric O
acidemias. O
Its O
pathophysiological O
process O
is O
mainly O
via O
the O

N-acetylglutamate B-CHEMICAL
synthetase. I-GENE-Y

Oral O

administration O
can O
correct O
hyperammonemia O
in O
neonates O
with O
propionic O
and O
methylmalonic O
acidemias, O
thus O
avoiding O
dialysis O
therapy. O
Isovaleric O
acidemia O
is O
an O
autosomal O
recessive O
disease O
of O
leucine B-CHEMICAL
metabolism O
due O
to O

For O
the O
first O
time, O
we O
report O
a O
neonate O
with O

acidemia, O
whose O
plasma O
ammonia B-CHEMICAL
concentration O
dropped O
dramatically O
after O
one O
oral O
load O
of O
carglumic B-CHEMICAL
acid. I-CHEMICAL
This O
experience O
suggests O
that O

carglumic B-CHEMICAL
acid I-CHEMICAL
could O
be O
considered O
for O
acute O
hyperammonemia O
resulting O
from O
isovaleric O
acidemia. O
However, O
trials O
with O
more O
patients O
are O
needed. O

The O

conclusion, O
these O

The O
interplay O
between O

is O
a O

The O
aim O
of O
our O
research O
was O
to O
find O
molecules O
able O
to O
interfere O
with O
the O
inhibitory O
activity O
of O
phospholamban B-GENE-Y
on O
sarcoplasmic O
Ca(2+)ATPase. B-CHEMICAL
For O
this O
purpose, O
a O
portion O
of O
phospholamban B-GENE-Y
was O
synthesized O
and O
used O
as O
target O
for O
a O
phage-display O
peptide O

The O

cyclic O
peptide O
C-Y-W-E-L-E-W-L-P-C-A B-GENE-N
was O
found O
to O
bind O
to O
phospholamban B-GENE-Y
(1-36) I-GENE-Y
with O
high O

Its O
functional O
activity O
was O
tested O
in O
Ca(2+)uptake B-CHEMICAL

utilizing O
preparations O
from O

By O
synthesizing O
and O
testing O
a O
series O
of O
alanine B-CHEMICAL
point-mutated O
cyclic B-GENE-N
peptides, I-GENE-N
we O
identified O
which O
amino B-CHEMICAL
acid I-CHEMICAL
was O
important O
for O
the O
inhibition O
of O
the O
phospholamban B-GENE-Y
function. O
The O
structures O
of O
active O

inactive O

alanine-mutated B-CHEMICAL
cyclic B-GENE-N
peptides, I-GENE-N
and O
of O
phospholamban B-GENE-Y
(1-36), I-GENE-Y
were O
determined O
by O
NMR. O
This O
structure-activity O
analysis O
allowed O
building O
a O
model O
of O
phospholamban B-GENE-Y

complex. O
Thereafter, O
a O
simple O
pharmacophore O
was O
defined O
and O
used O
for O
the O
design O
of O
small O

Finally, O
examples O
of O
such O

were O

we O
demonstrate O
the O

Perceptual O
learning O
is O
a O
special O
type O
of O
non-declarative O
learning O
that O
involves O
experience-dependent O
plasticity O
in O
sensory O
cortices. O
The O
cholinergic O
system O
is O
known O
to O
modulate O
declarative O
learning. O
In O
particular, O
reduced O
levels O
or O
efficacy O
of O
the O
neurotransmitter O
acetylcholine B-CHEMICAL
were O
found O
to O
facilitate O
declarative O
memory O
consolidation. O
However, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
role O
of O
the O
cholinergic O
system O
in O
memory O
consolidation O
of O

non-declarative O
learning. O
Here O
we O
compared O
two O
groups O
of O
non-smoking O
men O
who O
learned O
a O
visual O
texture O
discrimination O
task O
(TDT). O
One O
group O
received O
chewing O
tobacco O
containing O
nicotine B-CHEMICAL
for O
1 O
h O
directly O
following O
the O
TDT O
training. O
The O
other O
group O
received O
a O
similar O
tasting O
control O
substance O
without O
nicotine. B-CHEMICAL
Electroencephalographic O
recordings O
during O
substance O
consumption O
showed O
reduced O
alpha O
activity O
and O
P300 B-GENE-Y
latencies O
in O
the O
nicotine B-CHEMICAL
group O
compared O
to O
the O
control O
group. O
When O
re-tested O
on O
the O
TDT O
the O
following O
day, O
both O
groups O
responded O
more O
accurately O
and O
more O
rapidly O
than O
during O
training. O
These O
improvements O
were O
specific O
to O
the O

retinal O
location O
and O
orientation O
of O
the O
texture O
elements O
of O
the O
TDT O
suggesting O
that O
learning O
involved O
early O
visual O
cortex. O
A O
group O
comparison O
showed O
that O
learning O
effects O
were O
more O
pronounced O
in O
the O
nicotine B-CHEMICAL
group O
than O
in O
the O
control O
group. O
These O
findings O
suggest O
that O
oral O
consumption O
of O
nicotine B-CHEMICAL
enhances O
the O
efficacy O
of O
nicotinic B-GENE-N
acetylcholine B-CHEMICAL
receptors. I-GENE-N
Our O
findings O
further O
suggest O
that O
enhanced O
efficacy O
of O
the O
cholinergic O
system O
facilitates O
memory O
consolidation O
in O
perceptual O
learning O
(and O
possibly O
other O
types O
of O
non-declarative O
learning). O
In O
that O
regard O
acetylcholine B-CHEMICAL
seems O
to O
affect O
consolidation O
processes O
in O
perceptual O

learning O
in O
a O
different O
manner O
than O
in O
declarative O
learning. O
Alternatively, O
our O
findings O
might O
reflect O
dose-dependent O
cholinergic O
modulation O
of O
memory O
consolidation. O

Both O

However, O

The O

described O

The O

The O
question O
thus O
was O
raised O
whether O
L-BMAA B-CHEMICAL
leads O
to O
neurodegeneration O

Using O

In O

Consequently, O
the O

We O
previously O

vector O
that O
efficiently O
silences O

in O

in O

The O
vector O
originality O
is O
based O
on O
the O
fact O
that, O
in O

the O
siRNA O
molecule, O
it O
contains O
two O
components: O
1) O
a O
cationic O
liposome O
that O
auto-associates O
with O
the O
siRNA O

to O
form O
particles O
called O
"lipoplexes" O
and, O
2) O
an O
anionic O
polymer O
which O
enhances O
the O

This O
anionic O

can O
be O
a O

We O

or O

We O
next O
determined O
that O
the O
toxicity O
induced O

is O
a O

that O

We O
also O

that O

Furthermore, O

Estrogens B-CHEMICAL

the O

in O
mammals, O
including O
but O
not O
limited O
to O
reproduction, O

Given O
this O
widespread O
role O
for O
estrogen B-CHEMICAL
in O
human O
physiology, O
it O
is O
not O
surprising O
that O
estrogen B-CHEMICAL
influence O
the O
pathophysiology O
of O
numerous O
diseases, O
including O
cancer O
(of O

also O

as O
well O
as O
neurodegenerative, O
inflammatory-immune, O
cardiovascular O
and O
metabolic O
diseases, O

These O
actions O

the O

in O
the O
heart, O
ERα B-GENE-Y
appears O
to O
play O
a O
prominent O
role O
in O
most O
of O
the O

Pharmacological O
activation O

ERα B-GENE-Y

ERβ B-GENE-Y
provides O
already O
the O
basis O

therapeutic O
interventions, O
from O

However, O
the O
use O

these O
estrogens B-CHEMICAL

Thus, O
an O

now O
to O

ones. O
The O

both O

Within O

The O
only O

Because O

The O

Pitx3 I-GENE-Y
is O
critical O
for O
the O

of O

Pitx3-deficient B-GENE-Y
mice O
exhibit O
severe O

neurons, O
with O
accompanying O
locomotor O

Here, O
we O
identify O

that O

In O

Cell-mapping O

revealed O
that O
Pitx3 B-GENE-Y

in O
the O
ventral O
SN, O
a O

Furthermore, O
Pitx3-expressing B-GENE-Y

Finally, O

Thus, O

MPTP-resistant B-CHEMICAL
Pitx3-autonomous, B-GENE-Y
calbindin-positive B-GENE-Y

Pitx-3-dependent B-GENE-Y

that O
display O
elevated O

probably O
correspond O
to O
the O
subpopulation O
that O
degenerates O
in O

Impairment O
of O
Pitx3-dependent B-GENE-Y

therefore O
increases O

Together, O
these O

The O

To O

we O
have O
investigated O
its O

on O
the O

In O
this O
study, O
we O
discovered O
that O
FSAP B-GENE-Y
enhances O
the O
biological O
activity O
of O
mature O
BMP-2 B-GENE-Y
as O
well O
as O
its O
pro-form, O
as O
shown O
by O

These O
findings O
were O
complemented O
by O
knockdown O
of O
FSAP B-GENE-Y
in O
hepatocytes, O
which O
revealed O
BMP-2 B-GENE-Y
processing O

N-terminal B-CHEMICAL
sequencing O
indicated O
that O
pro-BMP-2 B-GENE-Y
was O
cleaved O
by O
FSAP B-GENE-Y
at O
the O

site, I-GENE-N
giving O
rise O
to O

(Arg(282)↓Gln(283)), B-CHEMICAL
as O

generating O
a O
truncated O

(Arg(289)↓Lys(290)). B-CHEMICAL
Similarly, O
mature O

was O
also O
cleaved O
to O
a O
truncated O
peptide O
within O
its O
N-terminal B-CHEMICAL
region O
(Arg(289)↓Lys(290)). B-CHEMICAL
Plasmin B-GENE-Y
exhibited O
a O
similar O

with O
FSAP. B-GENE-Y

Factor B-GENE-Y
Xa, I-GENE-Y

and O
activated B-GENE-Y
protein I-GENE-Y
C I-GENE-Y
were O
not O
effective. O
These O
results O
were O
further O
supported O
by O
the O
observation O
that O
the O
mutation O
of O
the O
heparin B-GENE-N
binding I-GENE-N
region I-GENE-N
of O
BMP-2 B-GENE-Y
inhibited O
the O

Thus, O
the O
proteolysis O

activation O
of O
pro-BMP-2 B-GENE-Y
and O
mature O
BMP-2 B-GENE-Y
by O
FSAP B-GENE-Y
can O
regulate O
cell O

and O
may O
explain O
why O

A O
brief O
history O

Over O
the O
past O
century, O
the O
polypeptide O
oxytocin B-CHEMICAL
has O
played O
an O
important O
role O
in O
medicine O
with O
major O
highlights O
including O
the O
identification O
of O
its O
involvement O
in O
parturition O
and O
the O
milk O
let-down O
reflex. O
Oxytocin B-CHEMICAL
is O
now O
implicated O
in O
an O
extensive O
range O
of O
psychological O
phenomena O
including O
reward O
and O
memory O
processes O
and O
has O
been O
investigated O
as O
a O
treatment O
for O
several O
psychiatric O
disorders O
including O
addiction, O
anxiety, O
autism, O
and O
schizophrenia. O
In O
this O
review, O
we O
first O
provide O
an O
historical O
overview O
of O
oxytocin B-CHEMICAL
and O
describe O
key O
aspects O
of O
its O
physiological O
activity. O
We O
then O
outline O
some O
pharmacological O
limitations O

in O
this O
field O
of O
research O
before O
highlighting O
the O
role O
of O
oxytocin B-GENE-Y
in O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
behavioral O
and O
neuronal O
processes. O
Finally, O
we O
review O
evidence O
for O
a O
modulatory O
role O
of O
oxytocin B-GENE-Y
with O
regard O
to O
psychostimulant O
effects. O
Key O
findings O
suggest O
that O
oxytocin B-GENE-Y
attenuates O
a O
broad O
number O
of O
cocaine B-CHEMICAL
and O
methamphetamine B-CHEMICAL
induced O
behaviors O
and O
associated O
neuronal O

in O
rodents. O
Evidence O
also O
outlines O
a O
role O
for O
oxytocin B-CHEMICAL
in O
the O
prosocial O
effects O
of O
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine B-CHEMICAL
(MDMA, B-CHEMICAL
Ecstasy) B-CHEMICAL

in O
both O
rodents O
and O
humans. O
Clinical O
trials O
should O
now O
investigate O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
oxytocin B-CHEMICAL
as O
a O
novel O

identified O
several O

The O
identity O

these O

remain, O
however, O

Here O

We O
find O
that O

due O

that O

We O
also O
show O
that O

One O
important O

role O

IDE B-GENE-Y
involves O
the O

and O
we O
find O
that O

are O
inversely O
correlated O
in O
β-cells O

Moreover, O
we O
provide O

that O
both O

Together, O
these O

The O
existence O
of O
adult O
β-cell O
progenitors O
remains O
the O
most O
controversial O
developmental O
biology O
topic O
in O
diabetes O
research. O
It O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
β-cell O
progenitors O
can O
be O
activated O
by O
ductal O
ligation-induced O
injury O
of O

and O
apparently O

cell-autonomous O
manner O

to O
double O
the O
functional O
β-cell O
mass O
within O
a O
week O
by O
differentiation O
and O
proliferation. O
Here, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
pancreatic O
duct O
ligation O
(PDL) O
does O
not O
activate O
progenitors O
to O
contribute O
to O
β-cell O
mass O
expansion. O
Rather, O
PDL O
stimulates O
massive O
pancreatic O
injury, O
which O
alters O
pancreatic O
composition O
and O
thus O
complicates O
accurate O
measurement O
of O
β-cell O
content O
via O
traditional O
morphometry O
methodologies O
that O
superficially O
sample O
the O
pancreas. O
To O
overcome O
this O
potential O
bias, O
we O
quantified O
β-cells O
from O
the O
entire O
pancreas O
and O
observed O
that O
β-cell O
mass O
and O
insulin B-GENE-N
content O
are O

totally O
unchanged O
by O
PDL-induced O
injury. O

reveal O
that O
PDL O
does O
not O
convert O
progenitors O
to O
the O

Thus, O
we O
conclude O
that O

Thus, O

MeHg B-CHEMICAL
also O

significantly O
increased O
DA O

that O
MeHg B-CHEMICAL

RATIONALE: O
Histamine B-CHEMICAL
H3 I-GENE-Y

antagonists, O
such O
as O
ABT-288, B-CHEMICAL
have O
been O
shown O
to O
possess O
cognitive-enhancing O

effects. O
On O
the O
surface, O
this O
might O
suggest O
that O
H3 B-GENE-Y

possess O
psychomotor O
stimulant-like O
effects O
and, O
as O
such, O
may O
have O
the O
potential O

OBJECTIVES: O
The O
aim O
of O
the O

was O
to O
further O
characterize O
whether O
ABT-288 B-CHEMICAL
possesses O
stimulant-like O

and O
whether O

METHODS: O
The O
locomotor-stimulant O

ABT-288 B-CHEMICAL
were O
measured O
in O
mice O
and O
rats, O
and O

The O

studied. O
RESULTS: O
ABT-288 B-CHEMICAL
lacked O

locomotor-stimulant O
effects O
in O
both O
rats O
and O
mice. O
Repeated O
administration O
of O

did O
not O
result O
in O
cross-sensitization O
to O
the O

that O
there O
is O

the O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
sum O
of O
these O
preclinical O
data, O
the O
first O
of O
their O
kind O
applied O
to O
H3 B-GENE-Y

that O
ABT-288 B-CHEMICAL

unlikely O

a O
high O
potential O

in O
the O
human O

hence O
does O
not O

shift O
the O

Other O
complications O
were O

as O

the O

resonances O
around O
the O
phosphorylation O

are O
specifically O

Despite O
these O

was O
an O
efficient O
tool O
to O

to O

Based O
on O
this O
analytical O

characterization, O
we O
show O
that O
WW B-GENE-N
phosphorylation O
on O
S16 O
abolishes O
its O
binding O
capacity O
to O
a O
phosphorylated B-GENE-Y
Tau I-GENE-Y

A O
reduced O

account O

Additionally, O
a O

that O
the O

that O

While O

The O
current O

covers O

on O
pharmacotherapy O

The O
core O
symptoms O
of O

include O
impairments O
in O
social O

and O
communication, O
as O
well O

as O
the O
presence O
of O

There O
are O
no O

for O
the O
core O
social O
symptoms, O
although O
effects O
on O
repetitive O

are O

with O
some O

While O
studies O
of O
fenfluramine, B-CHEMICAL
secretin, B-GENE-Y
opiates, O
and O
mood O

generally O
find O
no O
effect, O
mixed O
results O
suggest O
more O
research O
is O
needed O
on O

Newer O
lines O

including O
cholinergic O
and O

and O
oxytocin, B-GENE-Y
will O
be O
of O
considerable O

in O
the O

However, O
research O
on O
the O
treatment O
of O
core O

is O
plagued O

by O
limitations O
in O
study O
design, O
statistical O

and O
other O
issues O
inherent O
to O
the O
study O
of O

Background: O
Ectopic O

However, O
ectopic O

(ETTAG) O
is O
not O
easy O
to O

on O
the O

because O
it O
is O
so O
rare, O
the O

should O
first O
be O
considered. O
Here, O
we O
describe O
2 O
cases O

Summary: O
ETTAG O

To O

we O

Second, O

The O

In O

Further, O
exposure O

donepezil B-CHEMICAL
increased O
both O
burst-like O

large-amplitude O
EPSCs, O
and O
increased O
the O

were O
suppressed O
significantly O
in O

These O
results O
support O
the O

is O
able O
to O
recruit O
nAChR-dependent B-GENE-N

An O

Given O

we O

We O

those O

Furthermore, O

Expression O

both O

These O

Moreover, O

pattern, O
both O
increasing O
after O

Thus, O

The O

functions O
as O
an O
important O
barrier O
that O
separates O

from O
the O

and O
is O
vital O
in O

Mucosal O

the O

In O

We O
have O

Annexin B-GENE-N
A2 I-GENE-N

is O
up-regulated O
in O

IECs O
and O
plays O
an O

To O
identify O
the O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
AnxA2 B-GENE-Y

we O
used O

to O

AnxA2. B-GENE-Y
Loss O
of O
AnxA2 B-GENE-Y
inhibited O

These O

reported O
to O
play O
an O
important O
role O
in O
mediating O
the O

Since O

we O

These O

Evidence O
for O
a O
new O
mechanism O
behind O
HIFU-triggered O
release O
from O
liposomes. O
A O
promising O
approach O

for O
local O
drug O
delivery O
is O
high-intensity O
focused O
ultrasound O
(HIFU)-triggered O
release O
of O
drugs O
from O
stimuli-responsive O
nanoparticles O
such O
as O
liposomes. O
The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
investigate O
whether O
another O
release O
mechanism O
is O
involved O
with O
HIFU-triggered O
release O
from O
liposomes O
beside O
cavitation O
and O
temperature. O
Furthermore, O
it O
was O
studied O
whether O
this O
new O
release O
mechanism O
allows O
the O
release O
of O
lipophilic O
compounds. O
Therefore, O
both O
a O
lipophilic O
(Nile B-CHEMICAL
red) I-CHEMICAL
and O
a O
hydrophilic O
(fluorescein) B-CHEMICAL
compound O
were O
loaded O
into O
thermosensitive O

(TSL) O
or O
non-thermosensitive O
liposomes O
(NTSL) O
and O
the O
liposomes O
were O
subjected O
both O
to O
continuous O
wave- O
(CW) O
and O
pulsed O
wave O
(PW)-HIFU. O
The O
mean O
liposome O
size O
varied O
from O
97 O
to O
139nm O
with O
a O
polydispersity O
index O
(PDI)≤0.06 O
for O
the O
different O
formulations. O
The O
Tm O
of O
the O
phospholipid O
bilayer O
of O
the O
TSL O
was O
around O
42°C. O
Approximately O
80% O
of O
fluorescein B-CHEMICAL
was O
released O
within O
15min O
from O
TSL O
at O

temperatures≥42°C. O
In O
contrast, O
no O
fluorescein B-CHEMICAL
release O
from O
NTSL O
and O
NR O
release O
from O
both O
TSL O
and O
NTSL O
was O
observed O
at O
temperatures O
up O
to O
60°C. O
CW-HIFU O
exposure O
of O
TSL O
resulted O
in O
rapid O
temperature O
elevation O
up O
to O
52°C O
and O
subsequently O
almost O
quantitative O
fluorescein B-CHEMICAL
release. O
Fluorescein B-CHEMICAL
release O
from O
NTSL O
was O
also O
substantial O
(~64% O
after O
16min O
at O
20W). O
Surprisingly, O
CW-HIFU O
exposure O
(20W O
for O
16min) O
resulted O
in O
the O
release O
of O
NR O
from O
TSL O

(~66% O
of O
the O
loaded O
amount), O
and O
this O
was O
even O
higher O
from O
NTSL O
(~78%). O
PW-HIFU O
exposure O
did O
not O
result O
in O
temperatures O
above O
the O
Tm O
of O
TSL. O
However, O
nearly O
85% O
of O
fluorescein B-CHEMICAL
was O
released O
from O
TSL O
after O
32min O
at O
20W O
of O
PW-HIFU O
exposure, O
whereas O
the O
release O
from O
NTSL O
was O
around O
27%. O
Interestingly, O
NR O
release O
from O
NTSL O
was~30% O
after O
2min O
PW-HIFU O
exposure O
and O
increased O
to~70% O
after O
32min. O
Furthermore, O
addition O
of O

microbubbles O
to O
the O
liposomes O
prior O
to O
PW-HIFU O
exposure O
did O
not O
result O
in O
more O
release, O
which O
suggests O
that O
cavitation O
can O
be O
excluded O
as O
the O
main O
mechanism O
responsible O
for O
the O
triggered O
release O
of O
both O
a O
hydrophilic O
and O
a O
lipophilic O
model O
compound O
from O
liposomes. O
Dynamic O
light O
scattering O
analysis O
showed O
that O
the O
mean O
size O
and O
PDI O
of O
the O
liposomes O
did O
not O
significantly O
change O
after O
CW- O
and O
PW-HIFU O
exposure. O
Taken O
together, O
it O
is O
therefore O
concluded O
that O
neither O
temperature O
elevation O
nor O
inertial O
cavitation O
is O
essential O
for O
the O
release O
of O
both O
hydrophilic O
and O

lipophilic O
compounds O
from O
liposomes. O
It O
is O
assumed O
that O
the O
release O
originates O
from O
radiation O
force-induced O
acoustic O
streaming, O
causing O
the O
liposomes O
to O
collide O
at O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
exposure O
chamber O
leading O
to O
shear O
forces O
which O
in O
turn O
results O
in O
reversible O
liposome O
destabilization O
and O
release O
of O
both O
hydrophilic O
and O
lipophilic O
compounds. O

that O
DICO B-CHEMICAL

Subsequently, O

Quercetin B-CHEMICAL

are O
common O
flavonoids B-CHEMICAL
in O
fruit O

have O
been O
reported O

However, O
the O

of O
flavonoids B-CHEMICAL

In O
the O

(BMMSCs) O
were O
isolated O
and O
characterized O
for O
their O
use O
in O
osteoblast O

using O
two O
flavonoids, B-CHEMICAL
quercetin B-CHEMICAL

BMMSCs O
were O
cultured O
in O
various O
concentrations O
of O
quercetin B-CHEMICAL

rutin B-CHEMICAL
during O
the O
osteoblast O

10 O
days. O
Both O

Quercetin B-CHEMICAL

also O
increased O

by O
about O
150 O

200% O
respectively O
as O

Further, O
both O
the O
flavonoids B-CHEMICAL

also O
found O
to O

Arsenic B-CHEMICAL

activating O
the O
Nrf2-Keap1 B-GENE-Y

in O
a O

The O
Nrf2-Keap1 B-GENE-Y

is O
a O

promoting O

Activation O
of O
the O
Nrf2 B-GENE-Y
pathway O
by O
natural O
compounds O
has O
been O
proven O
to O
be O
an O
effective O
strategy O
for O
chemoprevention. O
Interestingly, O
a O
cancer-promoting O
function O
of O
Nrf2 B-GENE-Y
has O
been O
recently O
observed O
in O
many O
types O
of O
tumors O
due O
to O
deregulation O
of O
the O
Nrf2-Keap1 B-GENE-Y
axis, O
which O
leads O
to O
constitutive O
activation O
of O
Nrf2. B-GENE-Y
Here, O
we O
report O
a O
novel O
mechanism O
of O
Nrf2 B-GENE-Y
activation O
by O
arsenic O
that O
is O
distinct O
from O
that O
of O
chemopreventive O
compounds. O
Arsenic B-CHEMICAL
deregulates O
the O
autophagic O
pathway O
through O
blockage O
of O

autophagic O
flux, O
resulting O
in O
accumulation O
of O
autophagosomes O
and O
sequestration O
of O
p62, B-GENE-Y
Keap1, B-GENE-Y
and O
LC3. B-GENE-N
Thus, O
arsenic B-CHEMICAL
activates O
Nrf2 B-GENE-Y
through O
a O
non-canonical O
mechanism O
(p62-dependent), B-GENE-Y
leading O
to O
a O
chronic, O
sustained O
activation O
of O
Nrf2. B-GENE-Y
In O
contrast, O
activation O
of O
Nrf2 B-GENE-Y
by O
sulforaphane B-CHEMICAL
and O
tert-butylhydroquinone B-CHEMICAL
depend O
upon O
Keap1-C151 B-GENE-Y
and O
not O
p62 B-GENE-Y
(the O
canonical O
mechanism). O
More O
importantly, O
SF O
and O
tBHQ B-CHEMICAL
do O
not O
have O
any O

effect O
on O
autophagy. O
In O
fact, O
SF O
and O
tBHQ B-CHEMICAL
alleviate O
arsenic-mediated B-CHEMICAL
deregulation O
of O
autophagy. O
Collectively, O
these O
findings O
provide O
evidence O
that O
arsenic B-CHEMICAL
causes O
prolonged O
activation O
of O
Nrf2 B-GENE-Y
through O
autophagy O
dysfunction, O
possibly O
providing O
a O
similar O
scenario O
to O
constitutive O
activation O
of O
Nrf2 B-GENE-Y
found O
in O
certain O
human O

Recently, O
the O
c-Abl B-GENE-Y
kinase B-GENE-N
inhibitor O
imatinib B-CHEMICAL
mesylate I-CHEMICAL
(imatinib) B-CHEMICAL
has O
become O
the O
focus O
of O
research O
as O
a O
fertoprotective O
drug O
against O

cisplatin. B-CHEMICAL
However, O
the O
mechanism O
by O
which O
imatinib B-CHEMICAL
protects O
oocytes O
is O
not O
fully O
understood, O
and O
reports O
of O
the O
drug's O
efficacy O
have O
been O
contradictory. O
Using O
in O

culture O
and O
subrenal O
grafting O
of O
mouse O
ovaries, O
we O
demonstrated O
that O
imatinib B-CHEMICAL
inhibits O
the O
cisplatin-induced B-CHEMICAL
apoptosis O
of O
oocytes O
within O
primordial O
follicles. O
We O
found O
that, O
before O
apoptosis, O
cisplatin B-CHEMICAL
induces O
c-Abl B-GENE-Y
and O
TAp73 B-GENE-Y
expression O
in O
the O
oocyte. O

Oocytes O
undergoing O
apoptosis O
showed O
downregulation O
of O
TAp63 B-GENE-Y
and O
upregulation O
of O
Bax. B-GENE-Y
While O
imatinib B-CHEMICAL
was O
unable O
to O
block O

DNA O

and O
damage O
response, O
such O
as O
the O
upregulation O
of O
p53, B-GENE-Y
imatinib B-CHEMICAL
inhibited O
the O
cisplatin-induced B-CHEMICAL
nuclear O
accumulation O
of O
c-Abl/TAp73 B-GENE-Y
and O
the O
subsequent O
downregulation O
of O
TAp63 B-GENE-Y
and O
upregulation O
of O
Bax, B-GENE-Y
thereby O
abrogating O
oocyte O
cell O
death. O
Surprisingly, O
the O

conditional O
deletion O
of O
Trp63, B-CHEMICAL
but O
not O
ΔNp63, B-GENE-Y
in O
oocytes O
inhibited O
apoptosis, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
accumulation O
of O
c-Abl B-GENE-Y
and O
TAp73 B-GENE-Y
caused O
by O
cisplatin. B-CHEMICAL
These O
data O
suggest O
that O
TAp63 B-GENE-Y
is O
the O
master O
regulator O
of O
cisplatin-induced B-CHEMICAL
oocyte O
death. O
The O
expression O
kinetics O
of O
TAp63, B-GENE-Y
c-Abl B-GENE-Y
and O
TAp73 B-GENE-Y
suggest O
that O
cisplatin B-CHEMICAL
activates O
TAp63-dependent B-GENE-Y
expression O
of O
c-Abl B-GENE-Y
and O

TAp73 B-GENE-Y
and, O
in O
turn, O
the O
activation O
of O
TAp73 B-GENE-Y
by O
c-Abl-induced B-GENE-Y
BAX B-GENE-Y
expression. O
Our O
findings O
indicate O
that O
imatinib B-CHEMICAL
protects O
oocytes O
from O
cisplatin-induced B-CHEMICAL
cell O
death O
by O
inhibiting O
c-Abl B-GENE-Y
kinase, B-GENE-N
which O
would O
otherwise O
activate O
TAp73-BAX-mediated B-GENE-Y
apoptosis. O
Thus, O
imatinib B-CHEMICAL
and O
other O
c-Abl B-GENE-Y
kinase B-GENE-N
inhibitors O
provide O
an O
intriguing O
new O
way O
to O

GSH B-CHEMICAL

Thus, O

Among O

particularly O
useful O

We O
previously O
showed O
that O
the O
flavonoid B-CHEMICAL
fisetin B-CHEMICAL
not O
only O
increases O
basal O
levels O
of O
GSH B-CHEMICAL
but O
also O
maintains O
GSH B-CHEMICAL

under O

conditions. O
However, O

the O
mechanisms O
underlying O
these O

have O
remained O
unknown O
until O
now. O
Here O
we O
show O
that O
fisetin B-CHEMICAL
rapidly O
increases O
the O
levels O
of O
both O
Nrf2 B-GENE-Y

ATF4 B-GENE-Y
as O

as O

Although O
fisetin B-CHEMICAL
greatly O
increases O
the O

of O
both O
Nrf2 B-GENE-Y
and O
ATF4, B-GENE-Y
only O
the O
effect O
on O
ATF4 B-GENE-Y
is O

on O
protein B-GENE-N

Using O
siRNA O
we O
found O
that O
ATF4, B-GENE-Y
but O
not O
Nrf2, B-GENE-Y
is O
important O
for O
fisetin's B-CHEMICAL
ability O
to O
increase O

whereas O
both O

Based O
upon O
these O
results, O
we O
hypothesize O
that O

able O

increase O
GSH B-CHEMICAL

via O
multiple O
mechanisms, O
such O
as O
fisetin, B-CHEMICAL

BACKGROUND: O
Reentrant O

(VT) O
is O
known O
to O
be O

to O

However, O
we O

have O
previously O

catecholamine-mediated B-CHEMICAL

that O

to O
exogenous O
adenosine B-CHEMICAL
as O
well O
as O
to O

The O
mechanism O

is O
thought O
to O
be O
due O
to O
a O
catecholamine-induced, B-CHEMICAL
cAMP-mediated B-CHEMICAL

Valsalva O
on O

may O
be O

adenylate B-GENE-N

or O
to O
noncardiac O

Both O

T-mode O

putatively O

This O

The O

The O

if O

Thus, O
the O
most O
